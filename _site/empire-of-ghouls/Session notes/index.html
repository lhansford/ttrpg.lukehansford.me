<h2>Session 9 (2023-08-13)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Woke up in camp, looks like a nice day. Travelled most of the day to Obersteinau, a kobold mining town. We met a man at the front of the town who gave us a tour.</li>
<li>We visited the Miner's Rest to rest for the night. We ordered kebabs and stouts.</li>
<li>We heard a rumour that the mine was haunted and closed. We spoke to a bunch of kobolds and they semi-confirmed the problem (they didn't see it). We spoke to the manager Samuel and he hired us (400gp + cart and horses) to clear the mine. A small Kobold name Chippy is the one who saw the ghosts.</li>
<li>The next day we entered the mine to search for the cause of the problems.</li>
<li>In the mess hall we found Bronzetooth's Journal. We also found a shrine to Baal (Lawful ? dragon god). Fin said a prayer for his drake and offered a bloody coin as sacrifice.</li>

<li>To the north we found some mining equipment, including some copper ore that had veins of some magenta mineral inside.</li>
<li>We found a pit 60ft down with bones and a strange gem (looks like bismuth). Mara used Mage Hand to grab it and brought it back to the group, but when she touched it a bunch of shades popped out and attacked the group.</li>
<li>We fought the shades a bit but they hit us pretty well. Eventually we dropped the gem and they went away.</li>
<li>We decided to destroy the gem. Caelius divine smited it into powder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 11 (2023-08-27)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We met Viserra and she joined us.</li>
<li>Lars, the inkeeper in Obersteinau, recommended we talk with his cousin Harold, the Brewmaster in Gunnacks.
<ul>
<li>He warned us about the W* Canton of dwarves. Cranky, but good at fighting undead.</li>
<li>Also warned us about a griffon knight in Obertal who might be robbing people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We rested and then headed north.</li>
<li>On the road to Obertal we spotted a small fort and were approached by two griffon riders. Sir Gismondo, the one mentioned by Lars, tried to shake us down, but we mentioned our mission for Rava and he relented.</li>
<li>We continued on north of Obertal and camped for the night.</li>
<li>The next day as we travelled we encountered a pair of undead owlbears. We defeated them, harvested them for parts, and buried their victims.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 12 (2023-09-17)</h2>
<ul>
<li>As we cleaned up after fighting the owlbears a cart approached with two people. Noromos and Janta, travelling traders. They encountered ghouls two days to the north.</li>

<ul>
<li>The smart ghoul we killed was a follower of Vardesain (death domain god).</li>
<li>At the top of the ruins we saw more followers of Vardesain.</li>
<li>Caelius and Carrion went to talk to them. They invited them in for dinner, but they got the vibe they meant eating people and decided to attack.</li>
<li>We defeated the cultists.</li>
<li>In their camp we discovered a letter with a portrait of Archduke Avgost (the brother of the deceased king of Krakovar) with a message from ??? saying to keep an eye out for him.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 14 (2023-10-01)</h2>
<ul>

</li>
<li>A ghost boar approached our camp (monstrosity, not undead) but Finn scared it off.</li>

<ul>
<li>We spoke a bit with Brogan. He was surprised to hear we were on a mission from Rava.

</ul>

<li>We met Brogan and started to head off to where the undead are.</li>
<li>We came up on an abandoned farm. Jimmy and Finn snuck around the back.</li>
<li>In the farm was two skeletons and a ghost. The ghost had likely been dead for 2 years. This kind of shook Mara a bit.</li>
<li>We went down into the basement and found a dead body. There was a shield which brought out some rotgrubs when we picked it up.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Session 17 (2023-10-29)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jimmy had a mini panic attack for failing to spot the Roper, but we calmed him down. He scouted ahead in the tunnel.</li>
<li>We found a fork in the tunnel. To the right was a pile of rocks, we peeked over but couldnt see anything of interest. To the left was a barn door shoved into the wall. Mara picked it up and behind was a horde of zombies.</li>

<ul>

<li>Caelius took it in the end. In return he offered the info that he's a fugitive from Aucken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jimmy asked for advice on girls from the group. Mara walked off to case her Tent spell.</li>
<li>We returned to Grisal and Brogan took us to visit Trehild.</li>
<li>Trehild seemed standoffish, but we mentioned we were sent by Lena and the king, who was also in the room with Trehild, told her to let us in.
<ul>
<li>Trehild mentioned that the best info would come from the Court in Exile, but she doesn't know where they are.</li>
<li>Sister Adeline slayed Altmar the Sallow, a vampire lord at Yarosbirg. She died in combat but a scrap of her robe was retrieved.</li>
<li>The faithful of Sif placed the scrap in a reliquary to keep it safe.</li>
<li>There's a great temple to Sif in Jozht. The knights of Sif's order might be there, but the Court in Exile would know best.</li>
<li>The King uses a hammer to cast zone of truth on us.</li>
<li>He told us that the Queen of Krakovar and the old kings brother are still alive. They're hiding in Hirschburg, in Dornig.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 19 (2023-11-12)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We made our way towards Hirschburg via the Black Fortress.</li>
<li>As we approached the Black Fortress we saw that there was an encampment of Krakovian refugees.</li>
<li>At the gate we told them of our mission and they seemed welcoming. We met the commander and he was curious and friendly.</li>
<li>At night we went down to the refugee camp and met some people, entertained the kid.</li>
<li>The next day we left towards Hirschburg. On the way Mara saw someone following us.</li>
<li>We decided to camp as usual but set a trap for the follower.</li>
<li>Caelius took watch. He spotted the tail and dashed to try and catch them.
<ul>
<li>It turned out to be a ghoul spy.</li>
<li>Mara cast Hold Person and searched him. He had a paper describing our party.</li>
<li>Mara asked the group what they wanted to do and they said kill him. This made her pretty sad and she only half heartedly joined in the combat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We headed on to Hirschburg without any issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 20 (2023-11-19)</h2>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Ivo and the Archduke came and found us. Ivo guided us to an emerald green door. He asked us to spin around 3 times and then opened the door. On the other side was the Shadow realm.</li>
<li>We were confronted by shadow elves on the other side. Ivo spoke to them and they gave us passage, relucntantly.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We arrived at the Stone Galleries. There were some strange lifelike statues and a ruined temple to Holda</li>
<li>We got attacked by some creatures that turned people to stone. After defeating the basilisk, Mara tried to cut out its eyeball and accidentally got turned to stone. This is when a cockatrice attacked. Then also an ambush of ghouls. During the fight Mara turned into a ghost to escape the statue - maybe only Ivan saw?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 25 (2024-01-07)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We successfully made our way to Jozht.</li>
<li>We went to a tavern recommended by the Archduke. Outside was a group of dwarves doing some fighting. Jimmy joined them to try and get an in with the local thieves guild. He was pushed into the fight and lost, but they showed him respect. As he left though he tried to steal the other fighters ring. This lead to a confrontation that Caelius had to defuse.</li>
<li>The archduke paid us for escorting him and we parted ways.</li>
<li>We went to the Temple of Sif.
<ul>
<li>Caelius took the lead, but they refused to let any men in.</li>
<li>Mara just waltzed on through. She went and spoke to the leader, Yagoda Mezarak, and convinced them to let everyone in. Yagoda demanded a mock combat before continuing the convo, which Caelius won.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session 26 (2024-01-14)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We spoke with Yagoda about the robes. She told us they were in the possession of the Sisters of Hope. They were likely meeting at Yarosbirg in 2 days - 900 miles away. She told us she had a special &quot;red portal&quot; to get us there at the cost of 1000gp and not telling anyone about it.
<ul>
<li>200gp each. Mara covered for Caelius.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We reached the temple in Yarosbirg and met two Sisters of Hope. They were saying prayers over a burial mound and we joined them. As the sun set a group of cavalry led by a &quot;Ghost Knight&quot; attacked us. We wiped the floor with them, but one of the non-undead fighters surrended and then recognised Mara.</li>
</ul>
