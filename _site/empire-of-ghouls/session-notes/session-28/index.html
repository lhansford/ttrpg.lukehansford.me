<h1>Session 28 (2024-01-28)</h1>
<ul>
<li>We made our way up through the tower and go to the top where we fought an Iron Ghoul.
<ul>
<li>[[pcs/mara-nawojka|Mara]] turned ghost, [[pcs/jimmy-the-hand]] and maybe the others saw, but she faked it was a spell.</li>
<li>We defeated the ghoul/skeletons and rescued [[other/the-sisters-of-hope|The Spearmaidens]].</li>
<li>They told us that [[npcs/Sister Ylva]] had been taken to the chapel to be &quot;turned&quot; into a darakghul.</li>
<li>We sent the spear maidens to wait in the secret tunnel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We headed towards the chapel.
<ul>
<li>Outside we encountered some skeleton dogs but dispatched them without issue.</li>
<li>We entered the main building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We found the chapel
<ul>
<li>Inside was four people standing over [[npcs/Sister Ylva]]. As we opened the door they killed her.</li>
</ul>
