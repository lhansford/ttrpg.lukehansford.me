<h1>Session 26 (2024-01-14)</h1>
<ul>
<li>We spoke with [[npcs/yagoda]] about the robes. She told us they were in the possession of  [[other/the-sisters-of-hope]]. They were likely meeting at [[locations/yarosbirg]] in 2 days - 900 miles away. She told us she had a special &quot;red portal&quot; to get us there at the cost of 1000gp and not telling anyone about it.
<ul>
<li>200gp each. Mara covered for Caelius.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We reached the temple in Yarosbirg and met two Sisters of Hope. They were saying prayers over a burial mound and we joined them. As the sun set a group of cavalry led by a &quot;Ghost Knight&quot; attacked us. We wiped the floor with them, but one of the non-undead fighters ([[npcs/piotr]]) surrendered and then recognised Mara.</li>
</ul>
