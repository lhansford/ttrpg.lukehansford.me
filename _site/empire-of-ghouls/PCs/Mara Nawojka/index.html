<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Mara was an Elfmarked born and raised in Krakovar. She apprenticed and worked at the arcane library in the city and was settled in for a life of books and scrolls until the invasion. During the chaos she was slain, but hours later she awoke again as a Shade. Under the cover of night she snuck out of Krakovar and made her way south to Zobeck.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mara was a shy and cloistered person before her death. In her second life she realises that she had missed out on a great deal of living and has vowed to experience what she had only previously read about.</p>
<p>She's also burying the trauma of her and her colleagues being killed. This manifests in a dual perception of herself: her old introverted librarian self when she feels safe, and a grim and menacing necromancer when danger approaches. She is struggling to reconcile these two side of her personality.</p>
