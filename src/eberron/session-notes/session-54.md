# Session 54 (2025-02-18)

- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) resummoned Katama. The horse burst from his chest.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) inspected the orb, it seemed to be made of khyber crystal.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) identified it and said that it would go to a demiplane within [Khyber](locations/kyhber.md).
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) found two greater healing potions and a helm with Sylvan writing on it. It was a Helm of Comprehend Languages.
		- Vidi kept the helm, [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) took a potion each.
- We decided to use the teleportation orb. We arrived in a dark space, like an ancient ruin of sorts.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) stepped into the room and saw a man in robes in a sideroom. He asked who he was and Bumbo said he was just passing through.
	- Bumbo noticed some other creatures. Kind of bulky scaley creatures (slaads).
	- The man in robes said, "we've been infiltrated, to arms!".
- We managed to defeat them without too much trouble.
- We recognised that the Slaad are historically very chaotic, possibly native to either [Khyber](locations/kyhber.md) or [Xoriat](locations/xoriat.md).
- We headed deeper into the ruins. We reached are large set of doors. Atop it was written, in Slaad "Stillness brings you forward".
	- We tried to push open the door, but no luck.
	- We figured out that we probably needed to be still, but [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) kept pacing. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) cast hold person on him to get him to stop.
	- After about 40 seconds of quiet the door unlocked.
- We entered the next room.
	- There were pulsating orbs lighting the room.
	- To one side there was a busted vault door.
	- Another door had the script "Light the way forward" on it.
	- We went to collect the orbs. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) went through the broken door to get the orb there. It was dark and he pulled out his sword to light the room and found a creature covered in eyes staring back at him.
