# Session 14 (2024-04-16)

- I missed this session so notes are second hand.
- We met Zogek.
	- She kept Shagaby's amulet to study.
	- She's an expert on the Plane of Madness.
- Crew went to find [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md). He was locked up in a magic arena, we went in to find him, and we entered Mortal Kombat thingy.
