# Session 32 (2024-08-27)
- We started out in combat with the flying creatures Bumbo had seen visions of.
	- We managed to defeat the monsters. The main one complained about us removing the curse from Bumbo.
	- During the fight Bumbo got covered in a weird liquid.
	- We managed to defeat all the creatures.
- After the fight, Bumbo started to turn slightly translucent. We figured out he was turning into a fish and we got him into a barrel of water.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) spoke to [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) about how she though him jumping off the ship was cool but also scary.
- We got to [Fairhaven](locations/fairhaven.md) and went and got [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) healed.
- We then went to [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md) HQ.
	- [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md), [Shensari Damilek](npcs/shensari-damilek.md) and [Boroman Ir'Dayne](npcs/boroman-irdayne.md) were there.
	- We entered a room the Shensari said cannot be scryed, etc. upon.
	- Boroman told us he had a tadpole in his head. He also spoke about disliking the houses of Khorvaire.
	- We told him what had happened to us.
	- We also went into details about the assassination. Including [Adal Ir'Wynarn](npcs/adal-irwynarn.md)'s connection.
	- [Boroman Ir'Dayne](npcs/boroman-irdayne.md) told us they wanted us to go to [Ardev](locations/ardev.md) as well. There were excavations going on their and suspected their was a powerful artefact that allows scrying and telepathy on people there.
	- [Boroman Ir'Dayne](npcs/boroman-irdayne.md) is asking to do this so he can be cured
	- They offered us to become "trustees". We receive 1/5 of the Wayfinder's profits.
