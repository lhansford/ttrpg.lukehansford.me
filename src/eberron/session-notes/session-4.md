# Session 04 (2024-01-30)

- We went into the woods for about 2 days.
- At some point we came across a clearing with a few trees. We spotted a couple of very large creatures in the trees. They spoke to some of us in their minds.
	- One spoke to [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and asked to share memories with him. It wrapped its mandibles around his head and he felt woozy after, but everything was fine. It also mentioned that one of the party they're following was [Dragonmarked](other/dragonmarks.md) (Mark of Shadows, house Phiarlan or Thuranni).
- We continued on and came across a village. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) snuck in. Battle ensued.
