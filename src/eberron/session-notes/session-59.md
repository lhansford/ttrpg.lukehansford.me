# Session 59 (2025-03-25)

- We continued combat with the Inspired.
	- At some point [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) and Katama went down. Mynn absorbed the spirit of Katama and they both disappeared.
	- The Inspired transformed into a nightmarish creature.
	- Peren tried to stop the creature but it went into his mind. He felt the urge to destroy Elston and took him down. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) managed to banish [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md). The he spoke with the spirit who said he "needed his friends gone so he could bring the other one home".
	- The group managed to stabilise [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) and defeat the wargs.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) looked in the hut - it was much larger on the inside. She entered further to explore. She entered some sort of dreamscape.
	- Peren was banished to New York, on a subway train, where he spoke with the creature a bit.
	- Bumbo and Shagaby followed Vidi into the tent, but they managed to avoid the mind control of it.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) came back from banishment and team traded shots. The creature unpossessed [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) managed to banish.
- We fled into the cave as the creature had managed to plane shift back to the tent.
- We wandered a while and managed to find a place to stop and rest.
