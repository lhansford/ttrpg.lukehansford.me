# Session 08 (2024-02-27)

- We started off fighting an aberration. During the fight two people, a female spellcaster and a tentacley looking guy walked into the room, ignoring us.
	- As we continued fighting, the two people came into the room, took two items on pedestals, and left. As they left they raised the spell on the echo husks and collapsed the doorway.
	- We fought off the Echo Husks.
- In the room [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) looked at the table. On it was written in druidic references to the "tools of the gates".
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) investigated the abberration and felt very unsettled by it.
	- We took a rest in the room.
- After our rest we heard some mumbling from the other side of the collapsed door.
	- We cleared the rumble and found a female elf, Silaqui Nightbreeze. She was unconscious, [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) healed her.
	- She asked us who we were, we told them we were from the [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md) Foundation.
	- She mentioned that she works for the foundation instead of the "Clifftoppers" because they don't leave people behind.
	- She talked about getting ambushed by the creatures and seemed to be forgetting things. She had a dragonmark, the same as the creatures in the forest had shown [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md).
- We left the dungeon.
