# Session 43 (2024-11-12)

- We continued the fight with the oozes and Father Hoffsteader.
	- We managed to defeat them without too much effort.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) cornered Charles afterwards. He wouldn't give much info and insisted that what the Father did was just normal.
	- Rissa d'Deneith, the town guard, came up to investigate.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) spoke with Karis. Karis started asking about [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md).
- We got our items.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) spoke to [OthimDurgfelVoar](npcs/othimdurgfelvoar.md) about the "prophecy".
	- She insinuated she'd be studying her "poem" for 80 years.
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) gave everyone gifts.
	- She gave Peren a magic fishing pole that gives adv. on wisdom checks when fishing.
- Peren gave spell charms to Bumbo and Vidi.
- Bumbo said he had a date. Peren clocked that he's lying.
- [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) went and spoke to Karis and did some sort of trickery.
	- He seemed to think she was someone else and made some sort of exchange of goods.
		- A vial with purple liquid and a skull and crossbones on the lid was the main item. Plus a dagger with a carved-panther hilt.
	- Karis asked Rowan to tell Sanara "the if he sees any of her people anywhere near him, he'll figure out a way to make sure she pays. This pays his debt, he's done."
- Vidi, Shagaby, and Bumbo signed up for the poetry slam. Vidi cast greater invisibility on Peren and he snuck backstage as well.
