# Session 46 (2024-12-10)

- We continued the fight.
- At some point, giant tentacles reached down from the sky. They looked like they might be part of a larger creature we couldn't see.
	- The tentacles started shooting out lightning. They seemed to attack everyone. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) took a lightning strike which almost killed her.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) ran over and shook the sleeping [Arbek](npcs/arbek.md). He disappeared, as did [Rissa](npcs/rissa-ddeneith.md).
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) managed to heal [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) a bit.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) was incapacitated by the creature. In a vision he felt like he was in a smokey room and could hear [Meg](npcs/meg.md) talking to some dignitaries.
- The Quori left [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and attacked [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md), but [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) managed to keep it out of his mind.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) shook [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) awake. They didn't disappear.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) woke the the last sleeping figures on the beach awake and they disappeared along with [Aan](npcs/aan-dphiarlan.md) and [Cadoras](npcs/cadoras.md).
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) jumped in the water to pursue the Quori, but it knocked him unconscious.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) managed to get a killing blow on the Quori. Everything started to go dark. We awoke back in the Boastful Bard. There we saw the five assassins, unconscious on the ground. There was a sixth person unconcscious as well. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) checked the other room and found [Meg](npcs/meg.md) dead.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) suggested we kill them, but the other were hesitant.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) took all their belongings, including the rings of mind shielding.
- We decided to bring [Aan](npcs/aan-dphiarlan.md) in on it. [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) went to fetch her.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) searched the people for dragonmarks. [Ralsor](npcs/ralsor.md), [Annali](npcs/annali.md), and [Arbek](npcs/arbek.md) had marks of shadow. "The Shadow" had an abberant dragonmark that [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) recognised as a mark of House Vol, an ancient, dead bloodline from her homeland.
- [Aan](npcs/aan-dphiarlan.md) arrived and was surprised to see what was going on.
	- We told them everything that happened.
	- They mentioned she'd been keeping an eye on [Meg](npcs/meg.md). Meg came from a place where there were dream spirits that could follow people. She may have had a Quori spirit within her.
	- They said it sounded like we were transported to Dalkor, the realm of dreams in Xoriat.
	- We found a letter in [Ralsor](npcs/ralsor.md)'s confirming the connection to House Thuranni, but nothing specifically about the assassination.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) cast speak with dead so [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) could speak to [Meg](npcs/meg.md).
	- "How long have you had the assignment to kill me?"
		- "I didn't want to, but ever since you left town the first time."
	- "What happened to Keith's body?"
		- "It was taken to the mournland. To be disposed of and not be associated with our work. Not get a proper burial. Dread Metrol."
	- "What unfinished business do you have?"
		- "The farm. They harbour abberants, things that should not exist. They prepare for a wedding."
- [Aan](npcs/aan-dphiarlan.md) suggested we leave quickly so there was no connection to us.
- We returned to the airship to get some rest.
