# Session 20 (2024-05-28)

- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) spoke to [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md) separately to see if there's anything specific the Foundation wanted us to do on these missions.
	- He mentioned a Wayfinder trip to Xendrik in a few month, but other missions are on hold until the abberrant situation is handled.
	- Viken handed [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) a sending stone to get in touch with the Foundation if needed.
	- He mentioned keeping an eye out for antiquities. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) popped in and mentioned her dagger.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) mentioned Red, [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md) was concerned, [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) came over and explained what's going on.
	- [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md) said that the Foundation can take a look at it when we return. He suspected that is a "docent". A magical sentience that is sometimes affixed to warforged.
	- [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md) suggested we be wary of anyone from House Cannath in regards to Red.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) spoke with [Zogak](npcs/zogak-shul.md) and got some info on what to expect in [[Yrlag]]. She mentioned where [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md) could be found (Golden Dragon Inn?).
- We did a little shopping.
- We went to the airship and met the captain. The ship was called the Memento, the captain's name, Tartaresauce Hammer.
- We headed towards [Yrlag](locations/yrlag.md).
	- Along the way [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) worked on Biddy Bear a bit.
- We reached [Yrlag](locations/yrlag.md) and went to the Golden Dragon Inn. We spotted [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md). [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) asked the bartender to get him a round and tell him we're friends of Zogak.
