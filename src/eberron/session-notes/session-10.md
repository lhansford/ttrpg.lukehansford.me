# Session 10 (2024-03-12)

- We travelled on the road to [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md).
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) mentioned she studied magic on the island she's from, and that people don't really leave. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) asked how she left, but she deferred the question to [Thea](pcs/thea.md) who said she's on a "field trip, indefinitely".
- We travelled through a field, [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) and [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went and picked flowers.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) pressed his flowers in a book.
	- [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) asked [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) about the flowers and the book.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) said the book is his "life's work". A treatise on death and life.
	- [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) asked if he thinks she'll die. He said its a possibility, but something along the lines of death not being the end of the journey. She said she was afraid of not dying, but what she might become.
- We travelled for a few days without issue.
- On day 3 we reached the [Eldritch Groves](locations/eldritch-groves.md).
- On the fourth day we departed.
	- At some point [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) heard something in the forest. We try to listen for it again but didn't find the thing. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) and [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) snuck into the trees, while the rest kept walking. At some point [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) shouted out to whoever was out there.
	- We kept walking after a while.
- We continued travelling without issue.
- We camped and took shifts on watch.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) took a look at [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s hand eye while he was sleeping. It was closed.
	- On [Thea](pcs/thea.md) and [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s watch some kobolds attacked us.
	- During the fight one of the kobolds asked [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) for help, saying they didn't want to be with the other Kobolds.
