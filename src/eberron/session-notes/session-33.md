# Session 33 (2024-09-03)

- We travelled to [Ardev](locations/ardev.md).
- We visited the Golden Dragon Inn
	- The proprietor told us about the Ardev Market Days coming up.
	- We got some rooms.
	- Bumbo, Thea, and Vidi spoke to a lady name Aan for a long time.
	- A strange lady was staring at Forgettable for a long time. He started to talk to her and she asked if he knew "the one scorned by the forgotten prince of the jungle and fleet of foot".
		- Peren said he didn't recognise the description, although he did.
		- Eventually he went and spoke to her. Her name OthimDurgfelVoar and she had a warning for Peren not to change his course of action in order to protect "the trout" (in Silver Lake maybe). "Make sure the friend of the bear and the trees is not slain".
		- Something about a "panther" trying to kill them.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) asked the proprietor for the note. Apparently a bird had dropped it off a few days prior.
