# Session 30 (2024-08-13)
- We went and spoke with [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md) and told him we'd closed the gate.
	- He was pretty shocked by this. We told him the details.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) mentioned he'd thrown the amulet into the PoM.
- Lharc mentioned a person down in Zatash'ak called Grash Kala. They're an in-the-field researcher of Gates.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) started steaming at the hip. He ran off and his genie patron, Nuru, came to speak. She was angry that he'd thrown away the amulet. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) snuck off to follow Shagaby.
	- Nuru gave Shagaby horns.
	- She also asked him to do something "harrowing". There's a man in Breland, Boris Ir'Wynarn, a cousin of [Adal Ir'Wynarn](npcs/adal-irwynarn.md). He's hosting a summit of people from Eldeen Reaches, Breland, and Aundair, to discuss the border situation between the regions.
		- Nuru is asking Shagaby to make sure Boris is not killed by an assassin, some bard from House Thuranni. Hired by the Adal and the Queen of Aundair possibly.
		- The assassins have powerful magic, including magic rings that shield their minds.
- Peren sent a message to [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md). "We've cleared the ruins, sealed an open gate to Xoriat. Encountered the ilithid, Bhramara, but they escaped. Returning to Yrlag, figuring out next action."
	- He responded the next day, "Need to find a way to track the one creating these problems. I'll ask around. Get with Saucehammer, come back to Fairhaven."
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) snuck off to the bushes to do something.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) went down to the river to pray.
