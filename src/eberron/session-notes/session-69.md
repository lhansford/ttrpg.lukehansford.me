# Session 69 (2025-06-03)

- We continued fighting.
	- During the fight the Captain shouted "Release Cheery". It wasn't clear who he was talking about. He whistled and a Frankenstein-ish monster slammed out of a hidden door on the other side of the cavern.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) managed to banish Cheery, but he was yeeted down to the bottom of the chasm.
	- We sent Kathama down to pick him up [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md).
- We found a few spell scrolls (Chain Lightning, Fabricate, Dream). We also found 8 vials of black liquid, that were maybe drugs.
- Cheery came back from banishment but we made short work of him.
- We explore the room Cheery came out of. Inside was a bunch of Aundairian wine (illegal in Breland). Peren opened another door and we were attacked by more wraiths.
	- As we fought them, [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) and [Bhramara](npcs/bhramara.md) exited from a secret door.
	- [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) was covered in tentacles.
