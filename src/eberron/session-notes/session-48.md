# Session 48 (2024-12-24)

- We continues the fight at Hoffsteader Ranch
	- One of the people ran to unlock a barn. Inside was a abberant looking creature (Demeeter was the name, not that we knew).
	- During the fight our enemies started burning the buildings.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) reached out to his patron to help put out the fires, but got no response. He tried again, and she demanded one of our souls, which Shagaby wouldn't accept.
