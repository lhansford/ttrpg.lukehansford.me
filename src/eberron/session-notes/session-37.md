# Session 37 (2024-10-01)

- We managed to win the fight.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) got turned into a cat.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) got chatting with a Tortle after the fight. He mentioned there was a lake  (Silver Lake) nearby that had some magic properties - "just a bunch of fairies and stuff".
	- The Tortle was from Tortilla Bay. He suggested we need to wear red when visiting due to the pact with the fey.
	- His name was Tolsa
- lots a rando shit
- Peren refused to sign the bolt from Tolsa
