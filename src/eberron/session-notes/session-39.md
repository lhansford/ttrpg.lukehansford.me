# Session 39 (2024-10-15)
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) told us he could be telepathic.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went to check out the Grogg House.
- We reached the Casino
	- Outside we met Father Hoffstader and someone name Charles outside. They were asking for donations for the Silver Flame. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) got bad vibes. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) got chatty.
	- We spoke to Griglar and he pointed out a few people in the room.
		- He mentioned Boris' son, Bannis ir'Wynarn, was attending and that he's a bit of a black sheep of the family.
	- Aan greeted the group and bought a round of drinks.
		- She mentioned to [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) that there's another hobgoblin here.
		- She gave Bumbo a spellcharm of Catnap and he went to the bathroom to use it.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) cast Comprehend Languages and did a round of the room.
		- He heard Bannis being drunk and complaining about his father not understanding him.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) got to chatting with Barnaby Callstaff. He had trained under Shagaby's father.
		- Barnaby was here for the diplomatic talks. Shagaby scored a plus one for the talks to represent the Eldeen Reaches.
	- Forgettable went and spoke to Jelissa. She was absolutely not interested in him and quite rude.
	- Forgettable also spotted a woman named Meg who looked exactly like Thea. He started talking to her and Thea/Rowan ran over to join. Rowan appeared to be familiar with Meg and Shin Zin somehow.

		- He mentioned being from Valanar and in town for the diplomatic talks.

		- Cadoras also mentioned he was working on a wand that could clean clothes with a single cast and gave a prototype to Peren and asked for feedback.
	- Forgettable got to talking with Shin Zin about potions. She mentioned a place nearby that used to be good for mushrooms, but there's now a beholder in a cave there which means she can't get them anymore.
	- Shagaby spoke with Aan.
		- He mentioned Ralsor and Aan mentioned that he's House Thuranni.
			- Shagaby was a little sus on it. Aan seemed to be fishing for info.

			- Aan seemed to be House Phiarlan
	- Peren spoke with Lazrea
