# Session 65 (2025-05-06)

- We headed to the boat. As we entered it [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) noticed a bunch of damp fabric in the bottom of the ship. It rose as a bunch of ragged dolls that attacked us.
	- We fought the dolls, which woke a nightmarish fish - Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn.
	- The battle was extremely close, but [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) managed to banish the Queen.
- We managed to get the ship going. As we hit the wall of the [Mournland](locations/mournland.md) we were hit with a blast of necrotic energy that knocked everyone but [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) unconscious. They managed to heal or stabilise the rest of the group.
- We managed to leave the [Mournland](locations/mournland.md).
- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) went to explored and came upon a warforged and a halfling.
	- They were discussing some mission or something. They had a lot of supplies and a big cart.
	- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) reached out to the halfling telepathically. They got spooked and told [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) to show himself, but he wouldn't while the warforged was getting ready with a fireball.
	- He ended up sneaking away.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) got in contact with Tartar and got him to come to where we were. He said it would take a few hours.
- The group decided to return to the halfling and warforged and asked if we could camp with them.
	- The warforged was named Augur, the halfling was named Arvo Jorasco, of House Jorasco.
	- Arvo helped heal us.
	- They said they were heading into [Metrol](locations/metrol.md). Looking for something at the Temple of the Silver Flame.
	- When [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) said we'd been to the Temple the halfling got very cagey and accused Forgettable of stealing something from his family, a skull of some kind.
