# Session 18 (2024-05-14)

- We started out fighting the demon that held the wand.
	- Ape demon hit us pretty bad up front with 3 people going down. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) ran off to the north, the rest of us tried to fight the demon.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) entered a room with two more monsters in it.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went down.
	- We managed to get defeat the demon.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) reached [Thea](pcs/thea.md) at the same time. She appeared to be not breathing. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) picked her up and ran back through the maze towards [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md).
	- As [Thea](pcs/thea.md) lay on the ground she appeared to be different, with long brown hair and sharp features.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) tried to heal her, but she just popped up on her own and transformed back (v. suspicious).
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) had gone on ahead to find the wand and tripped a trap. We caught up and healed him.
	- We left the maze successfully.
- Florian greeted us as we left and served us tea.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) asked Florian about his nature and how he had come to be alive again.
	- Florian asked how hurt we were, [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) mentioned that [Thea](pcs/thea.md) had died.
		- We started arguing about that. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) was trying to say everything, [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) was trying to downplay it.
		- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) threatened [Thea](pcs/thea.md). Florian left to defuse the situation.
		- It turned out [Thea](pcs/thea.md) had made a pact with one of the devils, Olly, who had agreed to revive her in exchange for combatting the Plane of Madness.
		- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) shared more about Red, and it seems that he could heal a little. Red seems to want "change", i.e. see different things in the world (jury is out on how true that is).
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) danced around the fact that we saw her look different (only Shagaby and Peren, maybe Forgettable, saw the change).
