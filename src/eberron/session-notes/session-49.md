# Session 49 (2025-01-07)

- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) entered the burning house. [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) tried to enter as well but couldn't get through the smoke.
	- In the house a sofa fell through the second floor and landed on [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md), but he was able to get it off.
	- We managed to grab some books and a crystal.
		- "It's familiar, but not too familiar". A book about familiar.
		- "Are You Being Invaded?". A guidebook on surviving invasions.
		- "A Story About The Letter X". The best ways of hiding gold and making maps that lead to it.
		- "The Eye of the Silver Flame". Looks like a holy book, but looking further it's all flipped on its head, very heretical. Talks about a dark flame that's counter to the silver flame.
		- A large khyber dragonshard. Worth about 1000gp. Could also sub in for spell components.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) helped through the bodied in the fire and we snuck off to the north of the farm as people arrived from [Ardev](locations/ardev.md) to check out the fire.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) managed to grab a few items
		- A mystery key
		- A potion of longevity
		- A tentacle rod
		- 3 pendants that look like of the Silver Flame, but with a rendition of an eye overlaid.
	- As we tried to escape [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) dropped his staff by accident. He tried to use Thorn Whip to retrieve it, and managed to get it without being spotted.
	- We travelled for about 30 minutes to get some distance.
	- Bumbo freaked out a bit about the tentacle rod after using it as a backscratcher for a while. He gave it to [Rowan](pcs/thea.md).
- We got back to the ship.
	- [Garth](npcs/garth.md) was pacing unhappily.
		- He'd received a letter. He told us he's a conservationist. He'd been invited to [Thronehold](locations/thronehold.md) to research the trout population in Scion Sound. Boris had politicked a bit to make it happen.
		- He was unhappy because he felt bad for having to leave us.
		- We said we could take him that direction.
	- Sal was on the ship to see [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md).
		- They spoke in private.
		- Bumbo told him about the gatekeepers, turning into a jellyfish, etc.
		- He also said he was forgetting things and couldn't stop drawing this:
			- ![|0x200](_files/Pasted%20image%2020250107130725.png)
		- Sal seemed skeptical of Bumbo's committment. He mentioned something about a brother Billip.
		- Sal asked about the rest of the group. Bumbo was hesitant to say anything. He mentioned us clashing with [House Thuranni](other/house-thuranni.md). He mentioned the mark of death we saw as well, but Sal was skeptical.
		- Sal mentioned they're working for the Kingdom of Darkhan.
		- Sal said that [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) was actually [Kyle](npcs/kyle.md).
		- Sal told Bumbo he needs to find a crystal ball in the Sunken Temple, or maybe that the cultists in the woods have it?
		- Bumbo has a son?
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) prayed to the Queen of Death. She said he needs to return to her, he's an accounting error, and "see you in 6 hours, say your goodbyes".
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) told this to the rest of the group.
- We all spoke with [Sal](npcs/sal.md).
	- He told us [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) was [Kyle](npcs/kyle.md).
	- He told us the he's aware we were entangled with the aberrant menace.
