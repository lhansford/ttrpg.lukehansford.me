# Session 60 (2025-04-01)

- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Thea](pcs/thea.md) spoke a bit - she was apologetic for shooting Peren. Peren gave her some tips to better take him down next time, and spoke a bit about how lizardfolk dream, and how his lake of clan might make him weak to such magic.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) cast Air Bubble on the group.
	- We discussed a bit about the [Mournland](locations/mournland.md).
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) remembered when the mourning happened.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) also cast Telepathic Bond.
- We reached the end of the cave and had to climb a tall cliff.
- There was a room with some collapsed rocks at the entrance. [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) squeezed past the rocks and found a dire rat and some horrible creatures.
- We managed to defeat the creatures. There was a spell book in the corner.
	- There was a note in the spellbook "Love you Uncle Cassandro, Love Myla".
