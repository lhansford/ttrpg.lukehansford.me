# Session 16 (2024-04-30)

- Retcon to last session due to a line: [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) was cured but needs to retire from adventuring.
- We went and spoke to [Zogak Shul](npcs/zogak-shul.md) and [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md).
	- [Zogak Shul](npcs/zogak-shul.md) was curious about [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md)'s amulet.
	- [Zogak](npcs/zogak-shul.md) asked if he was familiar with [The Gatekeepers](other/the-gatekeepers.md). She mentioned they were ancestors of her.
		- Some abberations were sealed away in khyber, some in gems.
		- She suggested there is a creature trapped in [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md)'s amulet.
			- He was shocked to hear this.
		- Most of [The Gatekeepers](other/the-gatekeepers.md) reside in the [Shadow Marshes](locations/shadow-marches.md) these days.
		- Her ex, [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md), might know more about the abberations and she suggested we go visit him in [Goldmire](locations/goldmire.md).
	- [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md) talked a bit about [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s third eye. He seemed to indicate it was nothing to worry about.
	- [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md) had spoken to Imre from [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md). He's on his way to [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md) and we can chat with him about next steps.
- In the evening [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) put a dragonshard into Biddy Bear.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) has words with him about the origin of dragonshards and how it can be dangerous to consume them.
- In the morning Biddy Bear "awoke"
	- Red said he was cool, [Peren Ngintaku](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) was concerned.
- We went to the Maze.
	- There we met Florian Stitz. He seemed to run the maze.
	- We entered the maze.
		- At the start there were four doorways. We picked one and in the room was an apple on a table. [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) picked it up and it exploded in ice.
		- We ventured further and encountered an ooze-y creature.
	- We went to another room and met some demons. We sweet-talked them a bit and decided to play cards with them.
		- They wanted to gamble for the return gem.
