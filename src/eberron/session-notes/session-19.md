# Session 19 (2024-05-21)

- We headed back to Skyreach to rest.
- [Raulo](npcs/raulo.md) came and told us there'd be a big meeting in a couple of hours that we needed to join. The [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md) rep, Viken, had also arrived.
- We discussed a few things as a group
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) asked [Thea](pcs/thea.md) to maybe not run off so much.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) asked the group if they could have a signal for when everyone is lying. Scratching, in general, seems to have been the consensus
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) said the group should share secrets.
		- She told us about how she had run away from home.
		- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) told the group about his experience in the wars and how he was always the only survivor.
		- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) told us about his warlock contract. 
			- He used the lamp to help him and his brother escape a fire.
			- He maybe needs to get his patron back to the Plane of Fire?
			- They talk, but not often.
			- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) and [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) has suspicions about the cause of the fire.
			- Joining [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md) happened because of a fire that happened as well and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) stopped it.
			- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) gave [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) his dragonshard so that he wouldn't be tempted. The lamp seemed to glow hot red when this happened.
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) said she'd sold her soul.
			- She only needs to stop the Plane of Madness.
			- As we spoke her demon patron, Olly, appeared in the room.
				- Olly told us that Thea's soul is in escrow, until she fulfils her deal.
					- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) said she didn't feel anything different.
				- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) asked him why he cared about the Plane of Madness. Basically just self-preservation, he doesn't want competition.
		- [SapSago](npcs/sapsago.md) said he's not from the Elden Regions. He's actually from the Outlands. He used to work for an emerald dragon.
			- One day the dragon was pissy, so SapSago ran. He found a weird city and some stairs. There he saw 3 people, wizards maybe? They fed him and told him to "pick a portal".  That's how he ended up in Eberron.
				- The lady was Tasha, she offered [SapSago](npcs/sapsago.md) a job, he wants to get back to her.
			- He's actually from Sigil.
		- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) said his secret was that he could create food.
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) told us she was a changeling. She turned into Bumbo.
		- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) said his secret was he talks to Biddy Bear
			- He then said he talks back, tells him to keep on track, on mission.
- We went to the meeting.
	- [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md), [Zogak](npcs/zogak-shul.md), Adal Ir'Wynarn, [Raulo](npcs/raulo.md),\ and Vikin Buristal joined the meeting.
	- They asked to investigate the Plane of Madness stuff, on behalf of the [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md)s and [Aundair](locations/aundair.md).
	- There's a few avenues we could take
		- [Zogak](npcs/zogak-shul.md) thinks we should make haste and meet with [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md). Lharc has seen a large group of people of different kinds heading to the [Shadow Marshes](locations/shadow-marches.md). Potential cult activity.
		- [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md) kind of agrees with Zogak, but thinks we can instead infiltrate cultists in Zilargo. There's talk of some sort of tome there. He has an associate, Tristan, a Gnome spymaster in Zilargo can assist. He's in Oskilor.
		- [Raulo](npcs/raulo.md) thinks we could instead 
			- There's a hobgoblin (Zakarel?) in Zarash'ak, in the [Shadow Marshes](locations/shadow-marches.md). It's believed he has a direct line with "the silent folk".
				- **Khesh'dar** - “The Silent Folk,” a clan of golin’dar scouts and assassins. By ancient tradition, the Khesh'dar have always lived apart from the dar of the empire and serve no single clan, instead acting as impartial mercenaries.
				- They might have information we don't.
