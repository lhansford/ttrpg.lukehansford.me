# Session 02 (2024-01-16)

- We're taking the lightning rail to [Passage](locations/passage.md), and then north to [Duskwood](locations/duskwood.md).
	- We spoke with [Matushka](npcs/matushka.md) for a while and then headed to the station.
- In [Passage](locations/passage.md) we looked for transport
	- We got a job bodyguarding a worshipper of [Valaara](other/valaara.md) on the way to our destination.
		- The worshipper was called on a pilgrimage to a steaming crater near our destination.
