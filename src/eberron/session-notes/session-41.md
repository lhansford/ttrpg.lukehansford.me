	- Shagaby mentioned he got an invite to the conference.
	- Bumbo shared his conversation with Boris.
- We decided that the next day we'd attend the market days and then visit the Ir'Dayne's.
- Before bed Bumbo wrote a letter and then snuck downstairs.
- We got to the Market Days
	- Entering we saw Karis. Peren split off from the group to avoid association.
