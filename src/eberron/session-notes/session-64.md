# Session 64 (2025-04-29)
-  We emerged from the sewers into [Metrol](locations/metrol.md) proper.
	- There were no sounds that we could hear at all. No animals or anything.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) said he had a vision of one of the buildings and asked if we could go explore it. We agreed but also thought we should move quickly and quietly.
	- We tried move forward as a group. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) scouted ahead a bit. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) polymorphed into a flying dinosaur.
- We arrived at the cathedral. It was a temple to the Silver Flame.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) had some memories of the place.
	- He mentioned some women who raised him being "here" when it happened.
	- There was a fountain in the courtyard - as [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) approached we were attacked by glass monstrosities.
	- Near the fountain were 3 swords embedded in the ground. As we fought [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) approached the swords. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) shouted out to [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) not to touch anything as we were in the middle of a fight. He picked up the sword.
		- Picking up the sword he heard a femme voice asking him if he was worthy, and that they would learn in time.
		- It was a sword of the templars of the Silver Flame
	- We managed to defeat the monsters. As we did, we turned to see [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) holding the sword, completely stunned.
		- As he held the sword all his memories returned to him. He recalled that he had grown up in [Metrol](locations/metrol.md) as a member of the Church of Silver Flame.
		- He introduced himself to us as James of the Silver Flame.
- We left and headed towards the edges of [Metrol](locations/metrol.md).
	- We reached the swirling mist clouds on the edge of the city.
	- We needed to cross the river to leave.
	- There was a creepy house near the riverbanks. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) felt compelled to enter. As they did the doors and windows slammed shut.
	- The rest of the group started to attack the house.
	- We managed to get out eventually.
