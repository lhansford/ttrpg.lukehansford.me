# Session 40 (2024-10-22)

- ...
- Peren snuck away to investigate Sanara's room during her set. At first he tried to talk his way in, and when that failed he snuck in via the window.
	- He made too much noise and the room occupants caught him. He pretended to be a member of House Phiarlan.
	- Inside was Ralsor and a man named Karis. Karis was a sword seller in town for the market days.
	- They had a standoff and in the end Peren offered an octarine dragonshard to get away. Karis omniously say "this could come in handy".
- Shagaby and Bumbo got shots and went to talk with Bannis Ir'Dayne and Arbek.
	- Bumbo and Bannis got really drunk and he learnt Bannis was a sky pirate. Bumbo said he'd want to do that and Bannis called over Delphine Orien who told Bannis to "shut the fuck up" (i.e. she's probably a sky pirate).
		- Delphine is part of House Orien and is paying Bannis to be a sky pirate.
- Forgettable spoke with Jellissa. She gave him a pendant that looked like the one that Shagaby had (i.e pendant with a sealed abberation).
	- Shagaby took a look and it was definitely his amulet.
	- He cast Locate Creature and got a ping to the north. Most of the group ran off in pursuit, while Bumbo and Rowan stayed at the casino.
	- Shagaby got within 200 feet before the ping disappeared. He saw an eagle flying off. It headed in the direction of Whitehorn Wood.
