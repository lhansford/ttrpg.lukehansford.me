# Session 29 (2024-08-06)

- ...lots happened last time...
- We headed to the mirror that's actually a gate to Zoriat. We started the ritual to throw 6 magic items into the gate to close it, and be Gatekeepers.
	- We threw in Shagaby's amulet and the room got freezing cold.
	- We threw in another item and a few of us were magical put to sleep. We managed to wake them up with a combo of dispel magic and healing.
	- We threw in the Bloodaxe and a few people's legs were encased in stone. We managed to break them out.
	- Forgettable threw in the Vicious Morning Star. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) felt like something was taken from him after the ritual, but wasn't clear on what.
	- We threw in the Corpseslayer Glaive. Forgettable and Vidi were banished for a minute.
	- We threw in the last item and everyone but Peren floated to the roof. The mirror exploded and was closed, and Peren cast Feather Fall on the crew to keep them safe.
- We went back to see the ghost, but they were gone.
- We explored further and found a talking door. We gave it the name Doreen.
	- We spoke to Doreen for ages, and eventually they agreed to open the door.
	- Inside was 24000GP.
