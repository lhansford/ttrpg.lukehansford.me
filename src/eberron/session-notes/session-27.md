# Session 27 (2024-07-23)

- We continued fighting the monstrosity and eventually managed to take it down (not before it knocked us out multiple times).
- We spent some time inspecting the "portal/void hole". [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) wrote down the runes on the floor, but we didn't recognise it. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) threw in a jar with Light cast on it, but it only descended a bit and then just hung there. [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) compared it against his Kybher shard, but couldn't see any similarity.
- On  a side room there was a throne surrounded by blood splatters and bones (mostly skulls).
	- In it we found some dragonshards and secret passageway.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) recognised the sash on the throne, but couldn't place it. Vidi recognised it as Varryk the dragon.
		- We recognised that the gate had been taken over quite a while ago.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) found a room further on with some occupants.
- We went down the secret passage and at the end were a Gazer and some brain dogs. We managed to defeat them and then took a short rest.
- Peren cast Detect Magic and saw that there was some sort of spell on Bumbo, but of no known magic school.
