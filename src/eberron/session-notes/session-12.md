- We started out in combat with the drake and his lackeys.
	- We managed to defeat them.

- We left for [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md).
- We reached [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md) without trouble.
	- We found a small farming village with floating islands above it.
	- We met a man on a cart outside and we had a small conversation.
		- He told us to go to the rookery to get transport up to the school on griffins.
		- He also mentioned a shop/tavern called Alchemists Fire run by Gwen.
		- He said his name was Belton.
	- We went into the town to Alchemist's Fire.
		- We spoke a bit with Alyea, the bartender. We told her we were with [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md).
		- She introduced us to Ari who could take us up on a griffon.
		- There was another wizard (unknown) speaking to us at the bar as well.
		- We mentioned we need to see [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md). The unknown wizard mentioned Waldalix was an expert in curses. We said we're getting him to check out [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) and [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s weird eye.
- We ended on hearing some crashing sounds from the kitchen
