# Session 66 (2025-05-13)

- We shared a campfire with Arvo and Augur.
	- Arvo mentioned he was "kyber-bent" on getting into [Metrol](locations/metrol.md). He said "they took my family's graveyard".
	- He mentioned being from Boneyard and living on a farm there with his family, selling raptor eggs.
	- His grandmother had set up a mini-magical graveyard in a dragon's skull.
	- The graveyard was stolen during a raid
		- After eight years he tracked it to the Adherents to the Flame, a group out Thrane responsible for collecting magical artefacts to protect the nation.
		- The graveyard was en route to Sigilstar when the Mourning happened, and is likely in Metrol, in the cathedral.
	- Arvo mentioned that the Adherents to the Flame could send dreams to people.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) asked Augur who he'd fought for in the war, but he said he couldn't remember. [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) clocked that he was lying.
		- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) discussed it with [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) later on, we agreed to keep an eye on it, but not be overly suspicious.
- The ship arrived and we boarded. Augur and Arvo joined us. We managed to dissuade them of going in to [Metrol](locations/metrol.md). They seemed interested in joining [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md).
- We tried to get some rest. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) tried to attune to the sword. It spoke to him and made him swear an oath before attuning to it.
	- Bumbo tried to touch the sword afterwards and it shocked him a bit. Red seemed particularly affected. He was cryptic about it, but seemed very suspicious of the sword.
- [Viken](npcs/viken-buristal.md) mentioned one of the houses saying the lightning rail being rebuilt to [Metrol](locations/metrol.md). We agreed that was probably bullshit
- We scryed on [Bhramara](npcs/bhramara.md) and [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md). [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) seemed to look like she was in a bed of tentacles and her hands were clawlike.
	- "We found the way...its only a matter of time. All we need to do is walk thorugh...head east...head west. Those we serve will be pleased indeed."
	- We couldn't hear [Bhramara](npcs/bhramara.md) as he was talking psychically.
	- [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) mentioned the [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md)s, but didn't seem too concerned.
	- "Once we retrieve the orbs we'll have the seals broken, and the wedding will be on."
	- "We should cover our traps...I think we have enough corpses to mangle and create a defensive front. You'd think the demense of shadow would be a little more protected than this. Even the mightiest of houses is prone to fire or quaking of the earth."
	- They appeared to be hiding with House Phiarlan.
- We studied the scry together and identified they were probably somewhere in the region of [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md).
	- Probably in a cave, probably in a location the deals with smuggling.
