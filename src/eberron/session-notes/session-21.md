# Session 21 (2024-06-04)

- We told [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md) about our run in with the illithid.
	- He mentioned that a number of years ago there was an illithid colony outside Zerashak(sp?).
	- He also mentioned running in to some suspicious folks out in the wilds, camped around one of the old "gates". Some people with purple cloaks and possibly an illithid were there. He saw a [House Danath](other/house-danath.md) member in town getting supplies, looked a lot like one of the people at the camp. Lharc confronted him and asked him if he was camped out there - he said yes, but wouldn't say more.
		- The area was said to house one of the seals of [The Gatekeepers](other/the-gatekeepers.md).
		- Unsure if [House Danath](other/house-danath.md) would know what's going on.
			- They have a compound in [Yrlag](locations/yrlag.md).
	- We got on to the topic of [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md)'s play that he got from the goblin. Lharc mentioned that it was valuable and we might get some good coin from Lena Lyrander. She is building the airship tower, might also ask us about the airship we came in on.
	- He mentioned a shop called "Trailblazers" across the way where we could get supplies.
	- Lharc mentioned a community in [Droaam](locations/droaam.md) called [Thrakelorn](locations/thrakelorn.md) with people like [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md).
		- He mentioned a friend, Derek Veldaran, he has a mark. Connections with people in [Droaam](locations/droaam.md).
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) showed Lharc his amulet. Lharc was extremely shocked. 
		- Lhard said his Dad had certainly got it from the [Shadow Marches](locations/shadow-marches.md). 
		- The amulet came most likely came from Clan Taarn, who would seal daelkyr's in amulets.
			- There's a man Kuresh Taarn locally - he would have problems if he saw Shagaby wearing it.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) mentioned some two-headed doll that she can't seem to be rid of.
	- House Th... has a presence here, hunting for dragonshards.
- Group got up to rando shenanigans
- At some point a Mazia Lyrander. Came up to [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and asked who he and his group was. Asked if he had papers. He showed them, but was snarky about "made up laws". She left without further comment.
- We took the boat with [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md) to the encampment, and ended as we prepared to sneak up on them.
