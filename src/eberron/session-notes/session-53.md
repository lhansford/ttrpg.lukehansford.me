# Session 53 (2025-02-04)

- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) realised that he felt alive again, was hungry, etc.
- We went back to the Airship and got some rest.
- ["Fast" Elston Ford](pcs/elston-ford.md) mentioned that Katama's name meant "the darkness of night".
- After resting we headed to the forest.
	- We landed and saw the Nightmare from the farm next to a hut. We approached and one of the men from the farm stuck his head out of the door. He summoned a bunch of shadows to attack us.
