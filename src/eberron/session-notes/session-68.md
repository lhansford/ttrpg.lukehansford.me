# Session 68 (2025-05-27)

- We continued fighting the undead creatures, and managed to defeat them pretty easily.
- We searched the cabin in the cave.
	- Inside was a map that [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) took a look at. It seemed to mark out secret trade routes into the shadow marches. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) stuck it in her scroll case.
- We explored the next room. It was covered in dead bodies that all looked like members of [House Phiarlan](other/house-phiarlan.md).
- We explored one of the doors and were attacked by more undead.
