# Session 07 (2024-02-20)

- We reached the [Tomb of Lost Heroes](locations/tomb-of-lost-heroes.md). [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) snuck through the slightly ajar door. Inside he found a artwork on the wall of goblins etc. He smelt something kind of peppery ahead.
- Bumbo pushed the door open and we all entered.
	- Forgettable spotted traces of the party we're tracking.
- We moved into the next room and found some corpses on the ground. The creatures were strange looking, almost reflective and waxy.
	- Bumbo spotted some iconography on them consistent with the old goblin empire (from 7000 years ago).
- We move into the next hallway. There was a crackling sounds, like a fire, ahead.
- We were attacked by Dolgrim like the ones we encountered in the village.
	- During the battle [Thea](pcs/thea.md) found a dagger on an alter. She picked it up and it grew vines and wrapped around her hand.
- In one of the rooms we found some skeletons and a big hole. The hole is the deepest darkest black.
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) cast identify on the dagger [Thea](pcs/thea.md) picked up. It was a "Hungry Dagger", a Symbiont weapon.
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) cast Detect Magic. While she was ritual casting [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md), [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md), and [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) went to explore. We found a room with 3 coffins. On each was each of our names. We opened them and inside found dragonshards.
- We found some stairs heading up at the end of all the rooms on this level.
- At the top of the stairs there were a bunch of "Echo Husks". [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) spoke with them. They mentioned they were meant to guard the tomb, but were attacked by "people".
	- There was a fountain with acid in it, and a leg with a boot. It looked similar to one of the [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md) people.
	- They mentioned a woman and a man with tentacles for a mouth coming through as well.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) and [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) suspected the Husks are maybe charmed.
		- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) with her detect magic identified the Husks being under the influence of an enchantment spell.
- We entered another room. Inside was a statue of [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) and [Thea](pcs/thea.md).
	- The statue had a newspaper with the headline "[Dyrrn](other/dyrrn.md) and [Valaara](other/valaara.md) to wed in [Sharn](locations/sharn.md)".
	- We tried to open a coffin there, but it exploded with acid.
- We left that room and continued on. In the next room we encountered a large aberrant creature.
