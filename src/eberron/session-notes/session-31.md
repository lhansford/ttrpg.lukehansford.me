# Session 31 (2024-08-20)

- We discussed next steps and decided to go to [Fairhaven](locations/fairhaven.md) first before heading to [Ardev](locations/ardev.md).
	- We also discussed that we need to keep things on the down low about the assassination.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) tried to pull a boat out of his robe but accidentally got a horse instead.
	- We left the horse with [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md).
- We headed back to [Yrlag](locations/yrlag.md).
	- As we travelled along [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) started feeling ill again and said he could see a big bulbous creature. No one else could see it, but Bumbo was really freaked out. Thea shot an arrow in its direction and it disappeared. Peren cast Detect Magic and could see something was weird and off about Bumbo, but it was unclear what.
- We sent the message for Lharc in Yrlag and then headed to [Fairhaven](locations/fairhaven.md).
- Bumbo shared a picture of the creature he saw. We discussed it for a while until Captain Saucehammer called us up on deck.
- We were attacked by three of the creatures Bumbo had drawn. During the fight an even larger creature appeared and attacked. It spoke to Bumbo in his head (unknown to us).
