# Session 35 (2024-09-17)

- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) met up with the group and they went to the fighting place. We talked to Gundren about doing "The Gauntlet".
	- Some of the group spoke to Jenny, the bartender. She gave a bit of info on the tournament.
	- Jenny asked if we knew anyone at the Wayfinders paper - [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) said she had worked there. Jenny asked if the owlbear repellent is real. Vidi said she think it is, but its not scientifically sound information yet.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went and spoke to Orrin Fizzledripple.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) studied the opponents a bit.
	- Bumbo spoke a bit to Garth the giantkin and Terry the swobold.
- We spoke a bit about the group name (The Peanut Gallery). Peren and Thea weren't fully onboard.
- Thea also mentioned we should probably not mention all the time that we're Wayfinders.
- We started the fight
	- First round was against some robots who we handily defeated.
