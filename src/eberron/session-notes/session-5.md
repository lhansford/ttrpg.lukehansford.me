# Session 05 (2024-02-06)

- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) helped heal [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) a bit.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) investigated the house. It seemed like the creatures hadn't been there long.
- The creatures were definitely aberrant creatures
	- Left overs from the great war in the age of monsters.
		- War between the goblins, et al. and the [Daelkyr](other/daelkyr.md).
		- The [Daelkyr](other/daelkyr.md) would create aberrations.
		- The [Daelkyr](other/daelkyr.md) leaders have been bound in the underworld (khyber) by Orcs known as [The Gatekeepers](other/the-gatekeepers.md).
		- Some lesser aberrations can get out into the world still.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) noticed everything was made of wood and that the inhabitants were most likely druids.
- Signs of struggle around the village made us suspect that they were killed by the aberrations.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) suspected the druidic circle was [The Wardens of the Wood](other/the-wardens-of-the-wood.md). 
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) cast Detect Magic and explored the area.  She detected a chest that might be magical. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) took a look in it and found some robes and a potentially magic staff.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) identified the staff as a Staff of Flowers.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) found a wooden hatch in one of the buildings. He went down in to the basement but didn't announce it to anyone.
	- The basement contained more rooms and Bumbo went exploring.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) spent his time throwing the aberrations in the fire.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) did a round of the village and tried to find parts from the druids.
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) made some flowers on the grave Forgettable was creating.
- [[Bumbo]] started sharing the mead out to the group.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) found a pin of someone from [The Wayfinders Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md).
- The group went into the basement. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) spotted a number of aberration corpses that Bumbo had missed, as well as some tracks.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) opened a door and there was a Earth Elemental standing there. It asked for a password and Bumbo responded "wrong door". The elemental attacked us.
	- During the fight a water elemental also attacked us.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went in search of a password and found some druidic writing upstairs. She passed it on to [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md)  and he shouted it out to the elementals. They stopped attacking us.
- The elementals said they were protecting the cellar. The earth elemental was named Dirt. He said there were two people down here, [Olan](npcs/olan.md) and [Phrota](npcs/phrota.md).
- We went down the passageway and saw two druids in a room.
	- They mentioned the [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md) people came through and then shortly after the aberrations attacked.
	- They suspected the aberrations had come from the Tomb.
	- They mentioned a small goblin village nearby. The goblins are nice, but have mutations. They think its maybe because they live near the tomb. [Phrota](npcs/phrota.md) mentioned in might be "planar madness" and we all started to feel a paranoid feeling.
	- The invited is to stay and rest a bit. The showed us their underground grove. [[Bumbo]] went for a bath. [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) saw a reflection in the water and started talking to it.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) didn't want to sleep underground so [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) joined her upstairs to rest. The rest of group rested in the grove.
- Level up!
