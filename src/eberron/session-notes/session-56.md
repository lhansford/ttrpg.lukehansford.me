# Session 56 (2025-03-04)

- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) attuned to the crystal ball. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) kept an eye on him as he did. [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) noticed him and squirrelled it away.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) spoke with [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) about the blade. She was concerned that it might make us a target. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) tried to remove the blade but couldn't. They agreed to look into it after escaping the dungeon.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) and [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) took the first watch.
	- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) mentioned bad stuff coming up out of the mine in his home town. That was why he was after Bjorn.
	- He asked if we made good money adventuring as we all had decent gear. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) didn't really respond directly, and said he didn't have much use for money.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) asked [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) that he watch over the group if Peren doesn't make.
	- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) was reading a romance novel and said he could give [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) a copy when done.
	- We heard a sound like ice cracking coming from outside, but nothing more.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md), [Thea](pcs/thea.md), and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) took the next watch.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) complained about the way [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) woke her up, and said that she almost stabbed him.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) spoke about how it was his first time sleeping since he was revived.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) mentioned concerns about what was next - we defeat the beholder and then its just another thing.
	- They talked about what would happen if [The Silent Folk](other/the-silent-folk.md) took over. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) said she'd want to be reincarnated as a fern.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) took the last watch.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) asked [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) about the crystal ball.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) appeared to know how to cast scry with the crystal ball.
		- He scryed on a little bugbear kid. Turns out it was [Biggin](npcs/biggin.md). He talked with [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) about ti.
		- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) asked if [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) could take [Biggin](npcs/biggin.md) on as an apprentice so he could learn to be a wizard.
- We heard some falling rocks that woke everyone up.
	- The side tunnel [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) went through last time was collapsed.
	- The group entered the main room and confronted Bjorn.
	- During the fight [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) was pushed through one of the portals.
