# Session 11 (2024-03-19)

- We started off at the end of the battle at our campsite.
- We met [SapSago](npcs/sapsago.md). He defected, saying he didn't want to rob people.
	- The gang is lead by a drake.
- We decided to track them down in the morning.
- We sat at the campfire asking questions.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) said he wants to be the best diplomat in the world.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) mentioned his worst mistake was lying and bragging to a stranger he met in the jungle (he was a bit vague about it).
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) wants to be tougher so she can take a hit.
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) took a watch with [SapSago](npcs/sapsago.md) and trained him a little with a sword dance.
- Lots of talk at the campsite ðŸ˜´
- We travelled to the kobold cave. We snuck in with the plan to take down the drake and scare off the kobolds.
