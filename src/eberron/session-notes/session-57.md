# Session 57 (2025-03-11)
*I was away.*

- The group defeated Bjorn, and went through the portal to rescue [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md).
- Ended up on another continent with insect like creatures. Brokenblade mountains in [Sarlona](locations/Sarlona.md).
	- There was a vampire, [Klesterberg](npcs/klesterberg-ir-ormik.md). He was apparently related to royalty. Cousin with King of Karnath. He doesn't want to be known, we said we'd tell the inquisitor in [Sharn](locations/sharn.md) that he was dead.
	- He mentioned he'd arrived here via [Metrol](locations/metrol.md) and told us how we'd be able to reach there.
- Contacted [Sal](npcs/sal.md) who suggested we go to a place where there might be an airship port.
