# Session 44 (2024-11-19)
- The poetry slam started
	- Ralsor did a poem that had a secret message.
		- "They are on to us, meet at boastful bards three in morning"
	- Tang Toothclaw did a poem that mentioned Wayfinders. Might be a coincidence.
	- Bumbo did a poem about change.
	- Lazrea said a poem about slaying monsters.
	- Anna d'Ghallanda performed a poem about pancakes.
	- Vidi's poem was about science.
	- Shagaby did a poem about fire.
		- He sent a secret message to Cadoras in the message, warning him about the assassins.
	- Annali did a poem, maybe suggesting something happening in the morning.
	- Sal Dhar did a poem about dragons.
	- Farlay Kemble did a poem about dragons too.
- Rowan and Peren went to ask the fairy jeweller some questions.
	- Rowan was asking about the ring of mind shielding. Apparently if you die wearing it your soul goes into the ring (optionally).
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) went to speak with Cadoras privately.
	- They talked about the assassins. Cadoras said he'd inform the security by 6 tomorrow.
- We got together to speak privately
	- We shared Ralsor's poem, that Rowan got the weapon from Karris, and that the assassins had bought up all the spellcharms.
	- Thea refused to say how she had a safehouse in Ardev, other than saying she was under deep cover. We asked her to leave after she refused to explain further.
	- Bumbo also admitted to being a spy for the Silent Ones (he wouldnt call it a spy though).
		- Peren maybe clocked that the Silent One's can't be trusted
- We left the safe room and found Rowan and Meg gone.
	- We noticed a smashed window and bottle of ether.
	- Shagaby cast Locate Creature and we got on their trail, leading us to the Boastful Bard.
