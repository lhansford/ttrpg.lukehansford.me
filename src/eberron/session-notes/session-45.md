# Session 45 (2024-12-03)
- *Matt was out, Katie was mainly just listening in*
- We barged into the Boastful Bard.
	- No one was inside. There was a locked door and [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) noticed an illusion on one side of the room.
	- Approaching the door Bumbo could hear crashing waves, but he opened it and it was a regular workshop.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) went through the illusion and saw [Meg](npcs/meg.md) unconscious on the floor. He called the others in and tried to shake her awake, but everything went dark.
- We were transported to a rocky ocean shore
	- All over the place were people we had met in town.
		- On the beach, [Annali](npcs/annali.md), [Lazrea](npcs/lazrea.md), [Arbek](npcs/arbek.md), [Ralsor](npcs/ralsor.md), and [Sanara](npcs/sanara.md) all lay unconscious.
		- Scattered among the rocks jutting out of the ocean were [Meg](npcs/meg.md), [Aan](npcs/aan-dphiarlan.md), [Bannis](npcs/bannis-irwynarn.md), [Rissa](npcs/rissa-ddeneith.md), Cadoras, and [The Scorned Prince](npcs/the-scorned-prince.md) (who only [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) recognised).
		- Rowan laid unconscious on a shipwreck.
		- Meg said "please, you have to kill me" and transformed into a strange worm-like creature. The creature psychically projected out "Kill them" to the others and they began to approach us.
- Aan, Cadoras, Rissa, Bannis, and the Scorned Prince attacked us.
	- Rissa said something about "Outsiders, coming into town, messing with a good plan."
	- After hitting Aan, Bumbo noticed Ralsor squirm on the beach.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) defeated [The Scorned Prince](npcs/the-scorned-prince.md). He disappeared into mist and [Lazrea](npcs/lazrea.md) also disappeared from the beach.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) got mocked to unconciousness by [Bannis](npcs/bannis-irwynarn.md). [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) cast fly on [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) and he flew over to heal Bumbo.
	- Bannis was eaten by a shark and [Sanara](npcs/sanara.md) disappeared.
	- We ended with [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) getting incapacitated by the blue slugaloo.
