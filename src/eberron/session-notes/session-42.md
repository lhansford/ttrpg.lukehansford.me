# Session 42 (2024-11-05)

- Day 2 in [Ardev](locations/ardev.md). The group is at the market.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) went to a bookstore. Inside was Penelope Sivas and a warforged. Forgettable asked for "Anderath's Treatise on Death". They had it but he had no money. The warforged purchase the book for him. The warforged was named Augur 3.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) went around looking for some gifts for the team.
		- She spoke to one vendor about fishing rods - he had an enchanted one which she bought.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) (as Rowan) had visited Meg's house and Ralsor was there. They chatted as Meg made tea. 
		- Ralsor said he was at home resting peacefully the previous night.
			- Meg said otherwise later on, but Ralsor denied it.
		- Ralsor asked about the group.
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) asked about Aan and mentioned they wanted to know Ralsor.
		- Ralsor asked about who we were. She said that she was in the employ of the group.
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) mentioned expecting Sanara to kick off an assassination attempt or something.
		- Ralsor said Peren had broken in. Thea said Peren is probably a spy. He seemed to buy it. He suspected we might work for the "Hands of the Eyes of Breland" (i.e. for the king of Breland).
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) kept mentioning Aan and that they were interested in Ralsor. She proposed an alliance. Ralsor agreed if she gave dirt on Aan. Ralsor showed a dragonmark of shadow (particularly powerful). Ralsor suspected that Peren also had one and that "he's up to no good and should back off".
		- Ralsor more or less confirmed he was part of the assassination plan, then left.
		- Meg mentioned she was part of "The Eyes". Rowan was also! But we don't know that.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) spotted Ralsor leaving Meg's house and cast Locate Object to look for the assassin's ring. 
		- At first it pinged Ralsor, and after he left it pinged Lazrea.
	- Shagaby, Bumbo, Vidi, and Peren met up.
		- Peren spotted OthimDurgfelVoar, who sat down to chat with an orc.
	- We all met up and shared some info.
	- As Vidi, Forgettable, and Rowan were heading back to the group they came across Frederick the Tortle arguing with the Silver Flame and calling them heretics and scam artists.
		- They dragged him away, but as they did they noticed the fountain turning green. 4 big ooze creatures jumped out.
		- We started fighting them. Karis joined the fight.
		- OthimDurgfelVoar sat and drank her tea in the middle of the fight.
		- Father Hoffsteader seemed to stand still and his eyes glazed over.
			- Rowan threw a dagger at him, missed, and he turned into a nightmare monster with a dozen arms.
