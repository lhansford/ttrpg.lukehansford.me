# Session 01 (2024-01-09)

- We met the leader of [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md), [Shensari](npcs/shensari-damilek.md), in [Fairhaven](locations/fairhaven.md). She asked us to follow up on a group that went missing in [Duskwood](locations/duskwood.md).
	- We were sent to meet [Matushka](npcs/matushka.md), the owner of the Thirsty Snail.
	- We found her but were accosted by some local thugs who we promptly beatdown.
	- [Matushka](npcs/matushka.md) gave us each a magic item as a joining gift from the Wayfinders.
