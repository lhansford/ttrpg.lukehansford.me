# Session 17 (2024-05-07)

- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) won the card game with the shadow demons and [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md). They decided to come with us.
- We kept exploring and ran into some wraiths.
	- One hit [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) real good and reduced him to a total of 1 max HP
- We continued on and found a room with a big cauldron. As we entered two minotaurs appeared.
- We fought the minotaurs. Searching further we found the portal, but not the wand.
- We fought and defeated a giant skeleton.
- In another room we found a bunch of skeletons. The leader challenged [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) to a duel which Peren just managed to win. As a reward he told us where to find the wand.
