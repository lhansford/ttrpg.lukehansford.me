# Session 15 (2024-04-23)

- We started out in a fight with dinosaurs.
- We defeated the dinos, and the cube in the middle said round 2 in 1 minute.
	-  We looked for something to turn it off but no luck.
	- A bunch of fire elementals attacked in Round 2.
- We defeated the fire elementals
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) decided to smash the cube to bits.
	- It broke and the monsters stopped coming.
- The group tried to investigate but no luck. A few people got aggressive to [Raulo](npcs/raulo.md) because he hadn't told them immediately about the safeword to go through the portal.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went through the portal.
- A little while after a mimic appeared in the room and spat out [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md).
- We introduced ourselves to him and told him about [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md)'s situation.
	- We went back to [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md)'s office to discuss the situation.
	- We told him that we'd seen the illithid. 
- To cure [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) would be extremely expensive and painful.
	- Not really on the table. We would have to crush her head, take out the tadpole, and get someone to true resurrect her.
- We ended as we got ready to tell [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) about her situation.
