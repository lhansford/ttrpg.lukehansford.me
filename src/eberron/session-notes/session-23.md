# Session 23 (2024-06-18)

- We started out mid-fight. Eventually we beat the roper, but the invisible Akleu managed to get away.
- We followed the Akleu's path deeper into that caves. We reached a room that had a bunch of statues and gold all over the floor. At the end was a weird red portal door, as well as another door off to the side.
	- We noticed something off with the gold. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) cast Gust, which caused two hoard mimics to pop out and attack us.
	- We fought them off, though it was a real close fight.
	- Afterwards we realised all the gold was fake.
- After the fight [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) investigated the door at the end of the room.
	- He had a flashback to his youth, a fight that was a bit of a turning point for him.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) got curious and went to look at the door. He also had a flashback. A sad memory from his youth.
	- The door had illusion magic on it. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) let the group know. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) had to look, but she saw a happy memory.
- The statues in the room seemed to depict [The Gatekeepers](other/the-gatekeepers.md).
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) casted Identify on the portal door and realised there's a false magic aura on it masking what's actually going on with it.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) looked at the door and d saw:
	- "Forgettable's mom's name is Denisa, he was an apprentice cleric at the church, she gives good hugs."aw:
	- "orgettable's mom's name is Denisa, he was an apprentice cleric at the church, she gives good hugs."
