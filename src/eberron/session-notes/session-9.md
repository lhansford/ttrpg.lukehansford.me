# Session 09 (2024-03-05)

- We were at the top of the cliff over the [Tomb of Lost Heroes](locations/tomb-of-lost-heroes.md). [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) used Feather Fall and Misty Step to get most of the group down to the bottom. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) climbed down on his own.
- We decided to head back, with Forgettable taking the lead. He mentioned feeling familiar with the mountainous regions. [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) said we need to watch for tunnel gnomes.
- [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) asked us again if we'd found her friends. We told her we found one of her friends at the druid village.
- We decided to head directly to the druid village.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) and [Thea](pcs/thea.md) were exhausted by the time we reached the village.
	- We woke [Olan](npcs/olan.md) just to let him know we were there.
	- [Olan](npcs/olan.md) helped heal [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md).
	- We mentioned the tentacled person we saw. [Olan](npcs/olan.md) said he was likely an ilithid. Ilithids tend to serve the [Daelkyr](other/daelkyr.md).
		- He said he was likely an Alhoon, an ilithid skilled in magic.
	- [Olan](npcs/olan.md) talked about how ilithids aren't from Eberron.
	- [Olan](npcs/olan.md) showed [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) to a place where she could rest. After he came to us and told us that she had been infected by the Alhoon somehow and had a parasite in her head.
		- He recommended taking the road south and west to Arcanix. There's a large magic school there and we might find someone who could help.
		- [Olan](npcs/olan.md) was unsure if it was a creature or a presence or something else in her mind.
	- [Olan](npcs/olan.md) mentioned there was a "speaking stone" station in [Passage](locations/passage.md) where we could message the [Wayfinder](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md)s.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) showed [Olan](npcs/olan.md) his third eye and realised he could now see through it for short stints.
	- We rested overnight in the village.
	- When we woke [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s third eye had cast Detect Good and Evil and was pinging off [Olan](npcs/olan.md), [Phrota](npcs/phrota.md), and [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md). He accused them of having parasites. Peren told [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) his third eye was also a parasite. [Silaqui](npcs/silaqui-nightbreeze.md) found out about her infection.
- The group decided to head to [Passage](locations/passage.md) and then on to [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md).
- We reached [Passage](locations/passage.md) without issue.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) got pies.
	- We headed to the "Sivis Station", a place run by [House Sivis](other/house-sivis.md) where we can communicate from.
	- We sent a message: 
		- It's the Duskwood Group! Item recovered, Siloquy recovered. Only survivor. Siloquy is ill, heading to Arcanix to cure. Boroman, any connections in Arcanix?
	- [Boroman Ir'Dayne](npcs/boroman-irdayne.md) is the leader of [The Wayfinder Foundation](other/the-wayfinder-foundation.md).
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) asked [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) if he wanted to go see the lizard races. [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) was highly skeptical.
	- We got a response back, "Sad news indeed. Seek  [Waldalix the Wise](npcs/waldalix-the-wise.md) at [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md) and check back in with us as soon as you know more."
- To get to [Arcanix](locations/arcanix.md) would take about 5 days.
	- We made camp near the [Eldritch Groves](locations/eldritch-groves.md)
