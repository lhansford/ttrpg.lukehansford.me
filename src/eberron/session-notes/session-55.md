# Session 55 (2025-02-25)

- We started the fight against the two eye-covered monsters.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) got real big, which we hadn't seen before.
	- We defeated one and were winning, but during the fight [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) emerged from the vault door on the other side of the room. She had a crystal ball that was portraying our fight.
	- She said we were "too late, it's happening". She attacked [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) and reduced her to 0HP.
	- As we fought we all heard in our minds, "Jelissa, stop playing with your food, we have work to do in Dread Metrol".
	- [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) cast Power Word, Kill on [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md).
	- She fled, and we saw a grey arm reach through the door and close it. A voice chided her, "Jelissa, a waste of resources...".
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) was in a side tunnel and spotted them. He misty stepped to get up and attack [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md).
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) managed to revive [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md).
	- [Bhramara](npcs/bhramara.md) picked up [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md), cast Dimension Door, and went through one of the three portals at the north of the room. The portal disappeared. He said "Bjorn" as he went through, and a massive Beholder appeared in the center of the room.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) got up and seemed to have no idea what was happening.
	- Bjorn cast anti-magic and started hammering us. We decided to try and retreat.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) spotted the crystal ball on the ground and picked it up.
	- Bjorn told us to leave now, and we decided to do so.
- We rested in the cave with the plan two have a second try at Bjorn.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) said he planned to hold onto the orb like [Sal](npcs/sal.md) said.
