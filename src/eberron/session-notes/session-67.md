# Session 67 (2025-05-20)

- We decided to head for Gatherhold first. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) needed to talk to a Sharn inquisitor and [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) needed to using a sending station.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) approached [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) to ask why he needed a sending station. He offered [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) to use the crystal ball to contact his family instead.
	- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) contacted his father to check in. His father mentioned knowing [Viken Buristal](npcs/viken-buristal.md).
- We made a quick pitstop on Gatherhold
- [[Bumbo]] scryed on [Aan](npcs/aan-dphiarlan.md) to try and contact them.
	- They were at the Golden Dragon Inn when we connected.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) told them what we'd heard. They seemed hesitant to confirm the location of the hideout.
		- The mentioned the Demense of Shadow being a secret plane they had.
		- They said "they're headed right for [Elvinor](npcs/elvinor-dphiarlan.md)". Baron Elvenor d'Phiarlan. Head of House Phiarlan, and the mistress of the Demense of Shadow.
		- They said the location is in the foothills of the Blackcaps, on the border of [Breland](locations/breland.md) and [Aundair](locations/aundair.md). Two entrances. Look for a small carving of a hydra.
		- "Please give me news of "Rudley" and "Argon", and if they've been malformed or resurrected, please put them to peace".
		- They tried to give [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) a warning about something, but the scry expired just as they were saying it.
- We headed directly for the hideout
