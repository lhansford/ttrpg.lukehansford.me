# Session 47 (2024-12-17)

- Before boarding the ship [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) transformed back to [Thea](pcs/thea.md).
- We rested on the ship.
- We discussed if we could all trust each other.
	- We told [Thea](pcs/thea.md) about [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s spying.
	- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) said we should do group therapy.
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) wanted to tell us a story.
		- [Rowan](pcs/thea.md) was her brother, but died in the war. Only a few people knew, so it was kept quite so that she could take his appearance.
		- She ended up in [Ardev](locations/ardev.md) and made a connection with a man named [Kyle](npcs/kyle.md). She joined up with the Royal Eyes of Breland. They also later started working with [Meg](npcs/meg.md).
		- About 2 years ago they discovered some spies from [Droaam](locations/droaam.md) and there was an altercation. [Thea](pcs/thea.md) fucked up and crossed a hag, and that got [Kyle](npcs/kyle.md) killed.
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) defected/ran from the Eyes (and [Ardev](locations/ardev.md)) but finished the mission by taking [Kyle](npcs/kyle.md)'s form, getting captured by [Droaam](locations/droaam.md), feeding them false information, and killing Tzaryan Rrac before "escaping" to the [Mournland](locations/mournland.md).
		- Eventually she escaped. She wandered a bit, and eventually wound up at [Aundair](locations/aundair.md).
	- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) said she would prefer to avoid [Droaam](locations/droaam.md).
	- We discussed [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md)'s spying. We came to a tense-ish agreement that he could continue reporting, but would tell us what he was sending and hold back things we wanted to keep secret.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) mentioned his connection to [The Forgotten Prince](npcs/the-scorned-prince.md).
		- There was some discussion that maybe the curse wasn't affecting them because most of the group had already died.
	- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) mentioned communing with the god of death.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) said she was also cursed, with the doll that kept returning. She threw it out the window of the ship to show us, but it didn't return.
- We headed off to the Hoffsteader Ranch.
	- They tried to keep us away but we didn't stop and we started fighting.
