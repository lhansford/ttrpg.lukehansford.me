# Session 62 (2025-04-22)
*I missed this session.*

- The team continues exlporing the sewer. They found a room with a large pool of water and what looked like controls to control the water level. As they explored they were attacked by some ghost-like creatures.
	- We managed to defeat the ghosts
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) jumped in the water to explore. There were a bunch of pipes with valves.
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) pulled one of the levers at the controls.
	- We managed to move the gas enough to move forward, but were ambushed by 4 flaming skulls that took down everyone except Peren, Thea, and Shagaby.
	- We managed to retreat, only just. We took a short rest and returned to the skulls. We turned the last valve and it killed the skulls.
	- We went further on and found what looked like an exit.
- We left the sewers and emerge in the eastern side of [Metrol](locations/metrol.md).
