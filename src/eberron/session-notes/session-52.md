# Session 52 (2025-01-28)

*I was off this session*

- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) was transported to [Lady Illmarrow](other/the-queen-of-the-dead.md)'s castle. They chatted a bit and the rest of us were also transported.
- There was talk of a "draconic prophecy". [Lady Illmarrow](other/the-queen-of-the-dead.md) said that in the prophecy [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) would die, but she would give him the opportunity to cheat it.
- A shade version of [Jelissa](npcs/jelissa.md) was created and they fought. [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) was killed, but resurrected.
- [Lady Illmarrow](other/the-queen-of-the-dead.md) suggested she wants to leave her plane.
- [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md)'s resurrection bought him back to life for real.
