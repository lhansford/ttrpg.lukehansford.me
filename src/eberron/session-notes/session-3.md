# Session 03 (2024-01-23)

- We started the morning and made it through the day without issue. We arrived at the place [Val](npcs/val.md) was headed.
	- He mentioned receiving a vision that he wouldn't be leaving.
	- Val went down into the crater, got covered in ants and then "ascended".
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) had spotted some magic items in the crater. He jumped down to grab them and was attacked by big bugs.
	- After a tough battle we defeated the bugs. The staff turned out to be a powerful insecty staff and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) took it.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) also found an odd [dragonshard](other/dragonshards.md).
