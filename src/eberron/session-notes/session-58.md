# Session 58 (2025-03-18)

- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) reached out to [Boroman Ir'Dayne](npcs/boroman-irdayne.md) and informed him what was going on. He mentioned that Tartar would need to meet us east of [Metrol](locations/metrol.md).
- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) had some sort of psychic conversation with Katama.
	- Katama started talking about prophecies and stuff. He mentioned that [Sarlona](locations/Sarlona.md) (or maybe [Khyber](locations/kyhber.md)) was the land his parents came from. He mentioned something about the "original 67", quori spirits ("nightmares") that came here through a strange event 1400  years ago. A few "kinder" spirits also arrived, 7 of them. The came from [Dal Quor](locations/dal-quor.md).
	- Katama mentioned he could feel one very close, a spirit similar to him. He said we should be careful, and that they'd try to deceive us.
	- He mentioned that his real parents had been slain while trying to escape, but had got him to Quickstone where another family could raise him. The killer was known to the group somehow.
- We continued on through the tunnels and came across two wargs and a giant-looking creature.
	- He said that we couldn't pass as the cave was "the Mouth of Ketmal". He agreed to an arm wrestle with [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) to meet someone called Min. Bumbo managed to beat him, and said we could meet Mynn and Narth.
	- Mynn and Narth looked like very tall, lanky individuals. Elvish features, but also a little like goliaths.
	- [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) told [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) not to trust them as they're the folks Katama had mentioned.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) mentioned [OthimDurgfelVoar](npcs/othimdurgfelvoar.md) and Mynn asked if they were from Argonesse.
	- Mynn said that she and Narth were Inspired.
		- Katama told [Elston](pcs/elston-ford.md) that they were "Dreaming Dark".
