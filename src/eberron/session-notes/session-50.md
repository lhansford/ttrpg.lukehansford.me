# Session 50 (2025-01-14)

- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) asked [Sal](npcs/sal.md) what the plan of [The Silent Folk](other/the-silent-folk.md) was.
	- He said to rule over [Khorvaire](locations/khorvaire.md), but not through conquest.
	- The would rise "when the time is right".
- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) asked if [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) had any other surprises.
	- He said yeah and mentioned that during the war his house was attacked and burned down by Special Operation Gnomes. In the town of [Broken Tooth](locations/broken-tooth.md).
	- Bumbo's wife died in the fire, but his brother [Billip](npcs/billip.md) had rescued his son [Biggin](npcs/biggin.md). They were both hurt, Billip went to a shady shaman and got healed, but the shady shaman put them in debt. [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) returned from the war and tried to pay off the debt, and ended up getting help from [The Silent Folk](other/the-silent-folk.md) to do so.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) asked [Sal](npcs/sal.md) if he knew about [The Queen of Death](other/the-queen-of-the-dead.md).
	- She's an extraplanar entity. Maybe a threat, but maybe not.
	- He went in to a description of [Dollurh](locations/dollurh.md), the Realm of the Dead.
	- He was unsure who [The Queen of the Dead](other/the-queen-of-the-dead.md), but suspected that it would not be her who visited, but one of her "hands".
	- He mentioned [The Blades of Liberty](other/the-blades-of-liberty.md). An organisation that wants to overthrow [Breland](locations/breland.md). It's [Sal](npcs/sal.md)'s understanding that many Brelish who fell in the war were retrieved by them, specifically those who might have classified information.
		- [Sal](npcs/sal.md) had heard that they were working with some powerful necromancers who could extract information from the dead. There was a group of people though where things went wrong and they were "revived". Maybe 30-40 people. He thinks [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) was one of them.
	- [Sal](npcs/sal.md) suggested that perhaps having no memories would render [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) useless to [The Queen of Death](other/the-queen-of-the-dead.md).
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) handed out the Rings of Mindshielding.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) collected bits of everyone and put them in lockets, in case they need to revived.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) declined to participate.
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) asked if [Sal](npcs/sal.md) knew about his father.
	- [Sal](npcs/sal.md) said he could look into it.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) mentioned that the thing we needed to get from Silver Lake was collected by the beholder Bjorn.
- [Sal](npcs/sal.md) mentioned that [Biggin](npcs/biggin.md) was doing well, learning archery and artificing.
- We left [Ardev](locations/ardev.md).
- [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) heard a voice after attuning the ring.
	- The voice said they were "Lee". He said he was friends with a vampire and was a bear once, and he was in a jar - just a brain in a jar. Some people rescued him and became his friends. The friends beat up the Tarrasque and then turned him into a bear (Battle Enhanced Animalistic Ravager). It was confusing.
	- The mentioned going to Waterdeep and going to a restaurant called A Taste of Thay and learnt how to make a butter chicken.
	- He mentioned "crash landing" and ended up in Cyre. He also mentioned his body might be in The Mournland.
- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) also heard a voiced.
	- "Penelope" was the name. They were from [Sharn](locations/sharn.md) and going to school as a wizard.
	- She mentioned someone called Slime Shady.
		- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) recognised the name as a criminal boss in the underworld of [Sharn](locations/sharn.md).
		- Penelope was working a job for Slime Shady to get spell components, but died during the job.
	- She died a year ago.
	- She asked if she'd seen her friend Benny. Benny was a doll with two heads. [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) recognised the doll.
	- The doll was at the window. Penelope said that Benny was her best friend.
- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) tried to set up a trap on the ship.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went to [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) and apologised. She thought it was her fault for [Kyle](npcs/kyle.md) dying.
- As we approached the woods the Captain told us someone was signalling us from the ground.
	- [Peren](pcs/peren-ngintaku.md) insisted that they go down. All of them except [Thea](pcs/thea.md) went down.
	- [Sylas of Tortilla](npcs/sylas-of-tortilla.md) and [Deewayne](npcs/deewayne.md) were signalling us. They were in a flying contraption but were shot down by what sounded like one of the people from Hoffsteader Ranch.
	- They asked if they could lend a dragonshard to help get the machine working.
	- They also talked about some ghosts of orcs and warforged popping up every hour.
	- [Sylas](npcs/sylas-of-tortilla.md) mentioned that he woke up a few months ago with a tattoo on his foot.
		- We recognised it as a Mark of Scribing.
	- They showed us an invention they were working on called Echoers, that kind of worked like a radio.
- The ghosts appeared again.
