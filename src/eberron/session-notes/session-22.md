# Session 22 (2024-06-11)

-  As we got out of our boat, [Thea](pcs/thea.md) had a look around and spotted a camouflaged canoe in the bushes.
	- Peren checked out the boat. Rations from [House Danath](other/house-deneith.md) were in there.
	- [Vidi](pcs/vidi-veni.md) cast Detect Magic and noticed the boat was magic. Turns out it was a portable boat.
	- [Bumbo](pcs/bumbo.md) and [Shagaby](pcs/shagaby.md) used speak with animals to try and attract some birds to talk to. An egret came down to chat. They bribed it with pretzels, but he basically just told us what we already new. New info was that they saw an ilithid go through the stone wall there.
- [Thea](pcs/thea.md) shapeshifted to an illithid. We decided to enter the camp, faking that she was a friend of the other ilithid and we were her guards.
