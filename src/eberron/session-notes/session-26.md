# Session 26 (2024-07-09)

- We camped outside of the ruins. We split from the House Deneth troops and camped alone.
- [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md) mentioned having encountered lich-like illithids before (like [Bhramara](npcs/bhramara.md) claimed to be).
- [Lharc Suusha](npcs/lharc-suusha.md) mentioned a seal out at ?Xarryshak? which a community of Gatekeepers watched over. He suggested persuading some of them to come to [Yrlag](locations/yrlag.md) to repair the seal.
- We rested and went to clear out the ruins the next morning
	- We entered a central area where most of the group saw a hedge maze, but [Forgettable](pcs/forgettable.md) saw what the room really was.
	- As we entered a creature attacked us.
