## Custom

### Starchallenge Blade

Evocation Cantrip (Artificer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: Self (5-foot)
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 Round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and then becomes wreathed in starlight until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly attacks a creature other than you, the target takes 1d6 radiant damage, and the spell ends.

Cantrip Upgrade. This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage, and the delayed radiant damage increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d6) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d6)
