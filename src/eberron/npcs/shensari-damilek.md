# Shensari Damilek

- Shensari Damilek was a female human who was in charge of the relic and antiquities department. She handled the auctioning of certain items that were recovered during expeditions. She invited the group to meet with her. Shensari wore an elegant blue dress. She told the party that there was a dagger and some artifacts to recover from the ruins nearby. Another group had gone to the forest of Duskwood in search of a ruined temple, but had gone missing. She tasked them with a search and rescue mission. Hopefully, they would find the other party alive, but bring them back in any case or learn about their demise. She said that bringing back the artifacts was also a high priority since the group was in the area as well. Shensari arranged transport via Lightning Rail to the city of Passage for the party.
