# Peren Ngintaku

![[_files/peren-ngintaku-full-body.png]]

## Backstory

- Peren hails from a smaller clan (part of the larger Cold Sun tribe) in Q'Barra. He was raised to be a warrior and guardian of the clan. At 15 he was sent on [Walkabout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkabout) as rite of passage and spent 6 months wandering the jungles and wildlands.
- Returning to his tribe he found nothing but ruins. His tribe had been destroyed - by human settlers, House Tharashk dragonshard hunters, another lizardfolk clan, or darker forces he could not tell.
- He has spent the last decade roaming the land as a sword-for-hire, first travelling in Q'Barra, Valenar, and the Talenta Plains, and then finally fighting as a mercenary during the Last War. Each army he joined was defeated in battle, but he always managed to get a new contract with the victorious army and keep fighting.
- During his travels he has tried to seek meaning in what happened to his clan. They, like most of the Cold Sun, were followers of [the Silver Flame](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_the_Silver_Flame). While he still adheres to their mission to protect the dragonshards, he has no interest in the theological aspects of the faith.

  <h3>Cursed</h3>
  <p>When I was younger, he was bragging/lying about finding and defeating some Fey warrior (maybe the Forgotten Prince or one of his lackies) in the jungle. I managed to insult the archfey known as the Forgotten Prince. He cursed me so that people often ignore me and no one gives me credit for any of my good deeds or accomplishments, though everyone remembers my mistakes. There must be some way to break the curse, but I don’t know what it is. I have proficiency in Deception.</p>
</details>

## Goals

- To understand his curse (not necessarily break it!).
- A dry, black sense of humour.

## Personality

> What is the lie they tell themself?

That he deserves the bad things that happen to him.

### Traits

- I interpret every event as part of a larger pattern I just haven’t worked out yet. 
- He won't allow himself any vices.

### Ideals

- **Discipline**. Mastering oneself unlocks mastery over all.

### Bonds

- What good is being able to fight unless I fight for those who cannot protect themselves?
	- He won't loot a corpse of a humanoid - fighting is not for profit.

### Flaws

- He's overly self-sacrificing.

### Habits

- Will wake early each morning to practice sword forms in the morning sun.
- Fighting style akin to Taijijian
