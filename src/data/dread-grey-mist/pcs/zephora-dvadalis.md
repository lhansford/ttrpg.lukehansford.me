# Zephora d'Vadalis

![300x300](/_files/zeph-turnaround.gif)![300x300](/_files/zeph-token-full.png)
## Backstory

Zeph was an orphan of The Last War and was adopted by two magewrights living in [Sharn](locations/sharn.md). In her adolescence a Mark of Handling manifested on her and she was brought into [House Vadalis](organisations/house-vadalis.md). This was her first true experience of the natural world, and she fell in love with it immediately, simultaneously becoming a rising star within the house. Her philosophical views (and sharp wit), however, led to her clashing with factions with the house and being re-assigned to research [Metrol](locations/metrol.md) - a position that her enemies considered bottom of the bucket, but that Zeph intends to make the most of.

### Deep backstory

## Goals

## Personality

> What is the lie they tell themself?

That the Dragonmark houses can be changed from within.

### Traits

- Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life.
- Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.
- I love a good insult, even one directed at me.

### Ideals

**Discovery**. I want to learn all I can, both for my house and for my own curiosity.
**Honesty.** Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are.
**Balance.** Do not fish the same spot twice in a row; suppress your greed, and nature will reward you

### Bonds

- I can't leave behind strays.
- [House Vadalis](organisations/house-vadalis.md) opened my eyes to a new world I didn't know, and for that they have my loyalty.
- My house must evolve, and I'll lead the evolution

### Flaws

- I am easily distracted by the promise of information.
- I don't believe in 'shoot first and ask questions later' because I'd rather learn about something than destroy it first.
