# Session 28 (2024-01-28)

- We made our way up through the tower and go to the top where we fought an Iron Ghoul.
	- [[pcs/mara-nawojka|Mara]] turned ghost, [[pcs/jimmy-the-hand]] and maybe the others saw, but she faked it was a spell.
	- We defeated the ghoul/skeletons and rescued [[other/the-sisters-of-hope|The Spearmaidens]].
	- They told us that [[npcs/Sister Ylva]] had been taken to the chapel to be "turned" into a darakghul.
	- We sent the spear maidens to wait in the secret tunnel.
- We headed towards the chapel.
	- Outside we encountered some skeleton dogs but dispatched them without issue.
	- We entered the main building.
- We found the chapel
	- Inside was four people standing over [[npcs/Sister Ylva]]. As we opened the door they killed her.
