- The surrendered fighter was [[npcs/piotr]], a guard from the archives where Mara studied.
	- He spoke about how things weren't terrible at first, but have accelerated and he was looking for an out.
	- He told us about
		- [[npcs/grimslade]]. Darakghul. Leader at [[locations/orzelbirg]]. Hired directly by [[npcs/lucan]]
		- Captured Sisters, at [[locations/the-dread-fortress]], the castle of Orzelbirg
		- Broken Handle Inn
		- There's a hardass darakghul guarding the gate.
		- Dungeon is at the top of the NW Tower.
		- There's chapel in the main building where they're doing all their "bullshit".
		- There's supposed to be tunnel going into the NW Tower. Maybe look around the river. Word is the lord escaped through their.
	- He talked about his memories of Mara.
		- He mentioned buying Crab and Egg pies from Mara's parents bakery and bringing them to Mara while she studied.
		- He remembered trying to save Mara during the invasion, but Mara was surrounded by a horde.
- Sister Olga and Sister Dolthgar(?)
- We rested overnight and then travelled to Orzelbirg and searched for the tunnel.
- We found a cave with a bear inside. Mara lured the bear out with a fish and we snuck in to the tunnel.
