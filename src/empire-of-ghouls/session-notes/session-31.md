# Session 31 (2024-02-18)

- [Carrion](pcs/carrion.md) offered [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) a scroll of greater restoration, but he rejected it for now.
- It'll take 45 days of normal travel to get back to [Jozht](locations/jozht.md).
	- [sister-valendra](pcs/sister-valendra.md) came and visited us and suggested we get moving
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) tried to think of ways we could use the shadow roads, but came up short.
- The sisters suggested we should leave town quietly.
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) suggested she pretends to be "a baddy" and act like she's leading the others as prisoners.
	- We ended up just trying to walk out like we were supposed to be there. No one questioned us.
- We travelled for about a week.
	- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) continued to decline in health.
		- Mara was taking lots of notes on the process of [Darakhul](other/darakhul.md) fever.
	- [Carrion](pcs/carrion.md) persuaded [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) to accept the Greater Restoration spell.
		- The spell failed, but [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) passed it off as working.
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) tried to keep contacting the hag, but got no response.
	- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) had a fever dream. There was a dragon that spoke to him. It held a blue gem.
		- "You're alive because you're destined to be so. It has been recorded"
		- "Who destined it?"
		- "I did, when I recorded the fates of the world all those years ago."
		- "So who are you?"
		- "Hmm, I knew you would not know me. But today you will. I am [Khespotan](npcs/khespotan.md)...blah blah..."
		- [Khespotan](npcs/khespotan.md) brought [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) into the dream as well.
			- Mara noticed that the tablet [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) was carrying said "The Middle" in draconic.
		- "I need you in my service...I need you to accept your duty...it reveals itself as we march forward. I can not reveal that, that would be cheating."
		- "I demand from you [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md), each time you go to the see, I wish for you to honor me. Drop a coin in it, maybe two. For this, I will ensure the path is proper."
		- "[Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md), when your destiny arrives, you will know. And your destiny will end in the earthen arms of me."
		- He mentioned that [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md)'s destiny is not with him, but with something else.
		- We woke from the dream, each with a tablet as a gift from [Khespotan](npcs/khespotan.md).
		- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) now believes he's a "Warrior of Destiny".
		- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) recovered from his [Darakhul](other/darakhul.md) Fever.
- We travelled on another week and got near [Varshava](locations/varshava.md).
	- We decided to explore the city and try and find an entrance to the Shadow Roads.
	- We left the sisters at an overhang outside of the city.
- We managed to enter [Varshava](locations/varshava.md)
	- Near the entrance we saw some gallows with corpses hanging from them.
	- A guard questioned us, Mara said they were here for research, but rolled a nat 1 on persuasion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
