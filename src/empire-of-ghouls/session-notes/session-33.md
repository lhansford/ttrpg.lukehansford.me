# Session 33 (2024-03-03)

- We're looking for [Captain Sigurd](npcs/captain-sigurd.md) of the Osprey to take us north.
- [Caelius](pcs/caelius.md) asked [Jagoda Mazeruk](npcs/jagoda.md) if there was a way to improve his weapons. She recommended a friend, Erling, who deals in enchantment magic.
- We went to the smithy to look for equipment.
	- Erling offered a discount on an enchantment in exchange for Mara's drakes claw and the skull of an undead hound.
	- [Carrion](pcs/carrion.md) asked about his shield. Erling said if he leaves the shield with him he could improve it.
- We also visited Bjorg's shop.
	- He sold us a bunch of stuff and threw in a free spell scroll for Mara.
	- He mentioned talking to a man who said crazy stuff was happening in the North. I guy named Larry talking about Ragnarok.
- We went and said farewell to Jagoda and then headed to the docks.
	- We met Captain Sigurd.
	- He seemed cool with Mara's skellies.
	- [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) asked the Captain if he had transported anyway from Wolfheim to Jozht, but he said now.
	- [Captain Sigurd](npcs/captain-sigurd.md) asked us a few questions to get to know us.
		- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) told him he's a big romancer, but rolled a nat 1 on his persuasion check.
		- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) said he'd build a school for orphans if he had a lot of money.
		- [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) said he'd like an owl.
		- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) told him about the book she's writing, Nawojka's Necronomicon.
		- The Captain mentioned he'd heard about a wizard winning the log-throwing contest.
