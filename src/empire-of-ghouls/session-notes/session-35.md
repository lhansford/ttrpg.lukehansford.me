# Session 35 (2024-03-17)

- We managed to rescue [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) from the sea.
- Mara cast Gentle Repose on 3 corpses of the Sea Spawn
- We got some rest for the rest of the night.
- The next day [Captain Sigurd](npcs/captain-sigurd.md) asked us to drive the ship for him. [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) took the helm.
	- We managed to get by without the Captain.
- After 3 more days of travel we reached [Reaver's Cave](locations/reavers-cave.md). We saw some smoke as we approached. [Captain Sigurd](npcs/captain-sigurd.md) gave us a rowboat and said he would wait 2 days, any longer and he'd wait for us at Wolfheim.
- As we approached the cave we could see 3 dwarves at a fire and a giant boar.
	- We tried to get closer, but they spotted us.
	- We could see that in some cages were people. The dwarves were cooking them and eating them.
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) messaged them as we got closer. They said they'd "love to have us for dinner". We decided to attack them as we got closer.
	- We managed to defeat them pretty handily.
- [Mara Nawojka](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) found a gold ring on one of the bodies in the cages. She took a look at the cannibal dwarves. They looked very weathered.
- The dwarves were not undead, but seemed to have a ghoul-like desire for flesh.
