# Session 29 (2024-02-04)

- We started at the chapel in the [The Dread Fortress](locations/the-dread-fortress.md) at [Orzelbirg](locations/orzelbirg.md). As we opened the door we saw four figures standing over [Sister Ylva](npcs/sister-ylva.md). One of them stabbed and killed her.
	- A woman wearing dark red robes (the one who stabbed the sister).
	- A ghoulish figure in black robes.
		- Mara counter-spelled him a few times, but he managed to misty step out of the building. Mara managed to take him down with a Magic Missile.
	- A knight-like person similar to the one we previously fought at the Sif temple.
	- A [darakhul](other/darakhul.md).
- We entered battle
	- During the fight [Sister Ylva](npcs/sister-ylva.md) rose as a ghoul.
	- More guards came into the fight, but we managed to best them.
- At then end of the battle one of the guards surrendered.
	- He mentioned that we killed [Grimslade](npcs/grimslade.md) in the battle.
	- He also told us the sleeping gnome we saw was just a merchant.
- On the corpse of [Sister Ylva](npcs/sister-ylva.md) we found a necklace with a locket, inside of which was some fabric from [The Robes of Sister Adeline](other/the-robes-of-sister-adeline.md).

## Summary

This session was entirely battle. [Sister Ylva](npcs/sister-ylva.md) was killed, but we killed the four people overseeing her ritual. At the end we discovered [The Robes of Sister Adeline](other/the-robes-of-sister-adeline.md). ^Summary
