# Session 36 (2024-03-24)

- We met the leader of the Reaver Dwarves, [Skjorr Skullsplitter](npcs/skjorr-skullsplitter.md). He was riding a giant boar (Gorethon).
- [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) spoke to him and he invited us into the next room. There were more boars and another dwarf there. It looked like a living quarters.
- [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) mentioned we came because of a vision from a priestess of Sif. The dwarf said they worship [Vardisan](other/vardisan.md) and none of that Sif shit.
- [Skjorr Skullsplitter](npcs/skjorr-skullsplitter.md) said he eats humanoid flesh because its delicious and to worship [Vardisan](other/vardisan.md).
- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) asked if he was going to the wedding, he mentioned he was, but he didn't believe that Mara had been invited.
- [Ivan](pcs/ivan-antonovich.md) mentioned that his dad had sent them. [Skjorr Skullsplitter](npcs/skjorr-skullsplitter.md) didn't recognise the name, but said nobles tend to taste good.
- [Skjorr Skullsplitter](npcs/skjorr-skullsplitter.md) showed us his wedding invite. It would be at the midnight temple. Ceremony is in a week and a half, under the next full moon.
	- Morena, Chernobog, Vardisan.
- [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) pretended to shake [Skjorr Skullsplitter](npcs/skjorr-skullsplitter.md)'s hand, but then tried to yank him off his boar.
- We managed to overcome the dwarves and boars.
- We got the wedding invitation:

- We found some furs, a scroll case made of a human bone with a scroll of spirit guardians, a long sword and shield, a scroll containing a northern saga, silver trade bars, a bloodstone circlet, two potions of greater healing.
- On the shield, was an enscription from Rayngrid Ironeyes. A sister of Sif, asking us to return it to Huldramose if found.
- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) had heard of a great pit that was dug in the north. Inside was an old dwarven temple. It used to be a temple to Sif. It is now dubbed [The Midnight Temple](locations/the-midnight-temple.md), a temple to [Chernobog](other/chernobog.md), the lord of the night (competitor of Bastet). 
- We found a map (Midnight Temple is at Ruins of Nordheim).
