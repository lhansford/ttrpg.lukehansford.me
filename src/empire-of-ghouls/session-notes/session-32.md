# Session 32 (2024-02-25)

- The guards questioned us and were going to send us to the dungeon, but as we were standing there [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) noticed the hag from the shadow roads. She came up to us and told the guards that she was waiting for us. They reluctantly let us go.
- [Verna Woodrattler](npcs/verna-woodrattler.md), the hag, uses [Varshava](locations/varshava.md) as her mortal realm home (selling cakes to get money for spell components)
- She took us to a little village off the side of [Varshava](locations/varshava.md). She offered us pie. She took us to Phyliss' bakery
- [Verna](npcs/verna-woodrattler.md) asked us what we were researching. We told her we were trying to find passage to the shadow roads. She offered us help but required something from each of us in return.
	- [caelius](pcs/caelius.md) offered the location of his hometown.
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) offered up a future favour
	- [Verna](npcs/verna-woodrattler.md) wanted [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md)'s ability to steal. He was very reluctant and said he'd think about it.
	- [Carrion](pcs/carrion.md) offered his last breath
	- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) eventually agreed to give his motivation to steal.
- [Verna](npcs/verna-woodrattler.md) went with [caelius](pcs/caelius.md) to fetch [The Spearmaidens](other/the-sisters-of-hope.md). We had to pay off the guards a bit.
- [Verna](npcs/verna-woodrattler.md) took us to a mushroom circle where the entrance to the shadow roads was.
	- At the entrance [Verna](npcs/verna-woodrattler.md) asked for [caelius](pcs/caelius.md) information, [Carrion](pcs/carrion.md)'s last breath, and a coin from [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md).
	- The words to open the gates were "Blueberry pies" x 3.
	- We entered the shadow roads.
- We successfully navigated the shadow roads.
- We found a door that opened up into a closet in Jozht.
- We went to the Temple of Sif. [Jagoda](npcs/jagoda.md) greeted us.
	- [Jagoda](npcs/jagoda.md) offered [caelius](pcs/caelius.md) a new name - Amund of Jozht.
	- She healed [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md).
- We went to the tavern and met up with the Archduke.
- [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) spoke to [caelius](pcs/caelius.md) and asked him for advice on how to speak better.
	- [caelius](pcs/caelius.md) promised to make [Jimmy](pcs/jimmy-the-hand.md) his spymaster once he takes back his title.
- That evening [Jagoda Mazeruk](npcs/jagoda.md) had a vision as she slept.
- In the morning we visited the Temple of Sif again (for pancakes).
	- [Jagoda](npcs/jagoda.md) told us about her vision. "Dire portents and a harrowing task ahead." In her vision the dwarve reavers were feasting on flash.
	- Another vision of a woman in a red dress, a devotee of Morena, being wed to a vampire, perhaps Vardisan.
	- The vision points us to go to Reaver's Cave and find out what is going on with the reaver dwarves.
- [Jagoda](npcs/jagoda.md) has already chartered a ship to take us north to Wolfheim and the Reaver's Cave.
	- We should go first to the Temple of Sif at ??? and learn form the sister's there about what is happening in Wolfheim.
