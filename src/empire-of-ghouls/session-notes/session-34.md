# Session 34 (2024-03-10)

- We spent 2 days on the boat
	- [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) mostly sparred and studied
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) worked on her book.
		- Raspberry Pie returned to the dead, but Key Lime stuck around.
		- She got a little seasick.
	- [Carrion](pcs/carrion.md) studied [The Robes of Sister Adeline](other/the-robes-of-sister-adeline.md).
- On the third night there was some thunking on the sides of the ship. We went up to investigate.
	- [Mara](pcs/mara-nawojka.md) threw out some dancing lights, just as a bunch of "Sea Spawn" started to crawl on to the boat.
	- We fought them. We were winning the battle but a second wave of them arrived and started casting Darkness everywhere.
	- At some point the Sea Spawn started to flee, but then a Sea Serpent appeared on the side of the ship.
	- The serpent threw [Captain Sigurd](npcs/captain-sigurd.md) off the ship. He managed to swim back.
	- The serpent wrecked us and threw [Amund](pcs/caelius.md) overboard.
