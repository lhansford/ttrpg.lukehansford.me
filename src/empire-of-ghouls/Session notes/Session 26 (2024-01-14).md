- We spoke with [[Yagoda]] about the robes. She told us they were in the possession of  [[The Sisters of Hope]]. They were likely meeting at [[Yarosbirg]] in 2 days - 900 miles away. She told us she had a special "red portal" to get us there at the cost of 1000gp and not telling anyone about it.
	- 200gp each. Mara covered for Caelius.
- We reached the temple in Yarosbirg and met two Sisters of Hope. They were saying prayers over a burial mound and we joined them. As the sun set a group of cavalry led by a "Ghost Knight" attacked us. We wiped the floor with them, but one of the non-undead fighters ([[Piotr]]) surrendered and then recognised Mara.
