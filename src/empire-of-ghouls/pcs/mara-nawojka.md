# Mara Nawojka

tl;dr: She worked in an arcane library in Krakovar and was killed during the invasion. Now she's a shade.

## Backstory

Mara was an Elfmarked born and raised in Krakovar. She apprenticed and worked at the arcane library in the city and was settled in for a life of books and scrolls until the invasion. During the chaos she was slain, but hours later she awoke again as a Shade. Under the cover of night she snuck out of Krakovar and made her way south to Zobeck.

## Personality

Mara was a shy and cloistered person before her death. In her second life she realises that she had missed out on a great deal of living and has vowed to experience what she had only previously read about.

She's also burying the trauma of her and her colleagues being killed. This manifests in a dual perception of herself: her old introverted librarian self when she feels safe, and a grim and menacing necromancer when danger approaches. She is struggling to reconcile these two side of her personality.

### Traits

- The path to knowledge is not solely traversed through books and study. To fully learn, you must experience!
- I am an observer and chronicler of the journeys, experiences, trials, and tribulations of my companions as viewed from the outside looking in.

### Ideals

- Purity. The truth of a matter is subject to the whims of the historian. Facts are pure and incontrovertible.

### Bonds

- I always keep a journal. It grounds me to my past and organizes my thoughts. Without it, I would be lost.

### Flaws

- I was once confined in a prison of my own making. Never again will I limit myself to learning without experiencing.
- She's an "um, actually" kind of person.

## Appearance

- Bookish, timid.
- Mid 20s, mousy brown hair done in a bun, elven ears, brown eyes.
- Wears a dark green blazer over an ornate high collared blouse. Leather, fingerless gloves and leather knee high boots.
- Clutches a well-worn spellbook.
- When ??? occurs:
	- Hair fades to black and white.
	- Eyes fade to bright grey
	- Her eyes are shaded with deep black eyeliner and shade, as are her lips.
	- Blood appears to stream from her eyes and a huge gash from a weapon is visible across her forehead.
