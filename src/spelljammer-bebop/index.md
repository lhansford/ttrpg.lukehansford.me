# Spelljammer Bebop

You will start on a city called "The Rock of Bral" its a city on an asteroid in realmspace (where toril/forgotten realms is)  you all know eachother, from doing a few gigs together and we will work on some connections in our first sesh BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHAT ABOUT SOME OF THAT NOW.  You will need a reason to have been on "the rock" for aprox the last  year. You could be local, or from somewhere else. Either way, you have a patron (bounty hunting co) you want to all be working for, at least to start.

My plan is to have a lot of the research and such one of the big npc groups and  you will be a part of unlock new magical items and spells 

you will have opportunities to get a ship and make upgrades, and plenty of cool downtime stuff as we will be skill challenging and downtiming most of the travel between planets and realms.  expect your efforts to reward you with some 3rd party content (griffons saddlebag, kobold press, and my creations)

THEMES

Existentialist - finding purpose in the vastness of the worlds (researching magic? becoming a famous bounty hunter, starting your own group? passing something on to the next generation? Will you be a famous explorer, discovering new realms and remembered for your discoveries?) Exploring your character's "why" is going to come up a lot.

Consequences for actions Bounty hunting is going to be a big part of it all. This backdrop is going to amplify the theme if  you do someone wrong, there are folks that have the money and means to right it.  What one persons wrong may be another's right. Think about where your character came from and what consequences your position would put you in today.

Friendship and lonliness Wildspace can be an empty lonely place. The power of friendship and overcoming odds together against tough marks, monsters, and tyranny will be central to the campaign.  Lone wolfs need not apply.

Heroic High Fantasy in Space Yes you are on a ship.  Yes it is space.  But it is a magic ship, not a technological feat, and space as we know it is VERY different from how things work scientifically - this is more "treasure planet" than "star trek" but some exploration themes and such will overlap.

## Setting

- In [[locations/toril]], around 4020 (?).
