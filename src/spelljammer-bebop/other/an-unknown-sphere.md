# An Unknown Sphere

- A book we found in the [[other/the-red-wizards|Red Wizards]] haunted house near [[locations/mulsantir]].
- An Unknown Sphere by [[dubbuldux]]
	- Likely referring to [[locations/eberron]]
	- The Sphere of Dragons
		- Believed travel to and from this sphere is impossible
		- Thinks it might be possible to travel there via [[locations/sigil]] or some other esoteric means
		- Rumoured [[npcs/tasha]] can dream a group of people there.
			- Dealing with [[npcs/tasha]] is fraught with danger
		- There is a man/dragon named [[npcs/ames]] that might know how to get there too
		- Spelljamming ships cannot get there.
			- [[npcs/hallister-blackcloak]] captured a [[other/spelljammer]] (squid class) and studied it to see if it was possible, but 
		- "Long live [[npcs/szass-tamm]]" - sign off on book, hard to tell [[dubbuldux]]'s position on them though.
