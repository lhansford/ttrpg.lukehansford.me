# An Unknown Sphere

- A book we found in the [Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md) haunted house near [mulsantir](locations/mulsantir.md).
- An Unknown Sphere by [dubbuldux](npcs/dubbuldux.md)
	- Likely referring to [eberron](locations/eberron.md)
	- The Sphere of Dragons
		- Believed travel to and from this sphere is impossible
		- Thinks it might be possible to travel there via [sigil](locations/sigil.md) or some other esoteric means
		- Rumoured [tasha](npcs/tasha.md) can dream a group of people there.
			- Dealing with [tasha](npcs/tasha.md) is fraught with danger
		- There is a man/dragon named [ames](npcs/ames.md) that might know how to get there too
		- Spelljamming ships cannot get there.
			- [hallister-blackcloak](npcs/hallister-blackcloak.md) captured a [spelljammer](other/spelljammer.md) (squid class) and studied it to see if it was possible, but 
		- "Long live [szass-tamm](npcs/szass-tamm.md)" - sign off on book, hard to tell [dubbuldux](npcs/dubbuldux.md)'s position on them though.
