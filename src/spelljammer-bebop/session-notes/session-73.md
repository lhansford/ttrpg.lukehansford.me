# Session 73 (2025-05-04)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) sold the Githyanki Armor, but we decided to keep the extra Spelljamming Helm as a backup.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) spoke to [Raven](pcs/raven.md) about being a bit trepidatious about rescuing [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md). [Raven](pcs/raven.md) reassured her. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) said that maybe she didn't want to change back â€” [Raven](pcs/raven.md) said she should tell [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) that. She also suggested [Swan](pcs/swan.md) use our adventures as inspiration for a play.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) took [Myla](npcs/myla.md) fishing. They went to a park in [Sigil](locations/sigil.md). [Myla](npcs/myla.md) talked about wanting to go back to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md).
	- She talked a bit about the Lizardfolk of [Eberron](locations/eberron.md).
	- [The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md) tried to get [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) to attack [Myla](npcs/myla.md), but he resisted it.
	- He told [Myla](npcs/myla.md) that [The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md) was interested in her. She was surprised when he told her that no one else knew and said they should immediately return to the rest of the group.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) reached out to his patron, [Zisa](npcs/zisa.md).
	- He told her that [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md) was defeated and asked if he should return his powers.
	- She said there's more work to be done. That maybe includes [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md). "With her your task is not vengeance, it's judgement."
	- He asked "What if we're wrong?". 
	- She said [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) is beyond saving.
- [Myla](npcs/myla.md) got back to the Sanctum. She told us about [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) and the group confronted him. We managed to calm [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) down. [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) spoke to [The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md) who said that the prophecy demanded she die ("one life for many").
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) said the curse on him was witch-like in nature, and we surmised that maybe [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) could help us out.
	- We joined [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) in casting a spell to try and protect [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md)'s mind for 30 days. She cast Geas on him, which managed to work, but only for about 16 days.
- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) said she could send us to [Carceri](locations/carceri.md), but not bring her back. Maybe we can find passage down the River Styx. [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) should be able to find the river.
- We left to go to [Carceri](locations/carceri.md).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) gave her Cloak of Shadows and told her to stay safe.
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) said we would be looking for a citadel upon a mountain.
	- We would be going to one of 3 places:
		- Cathrys. A fetid junglelike place.
		- Colothys. Deep chasms, mountainous. Impossible to travel on foot.
		- Agathys. Cold cold cold.
	- We entered the portal and arrived in [Carceri](locations/carceri.md). We were at the bottom of a chasm. Everything was grey and red. It appeared to be Colothys, the fourth layer of [Carceri](locations/carceri.md).
	- As we exited the portal we were attacked by a bunch of demons who said we look tasty.
