# Session 22 (2024-03-31)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) approached [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) to tell him she thought he did the right thing by trying to save the manticore egg.
	- He was reading his self-help book and they spoke a bit about the crew being like family and who had taught and mentored them.

	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) told us he made a pact with a devil. It was at magic school and he and his friends got cocky and tried to summon a devil. Only [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) survived. He's fairly certain he sold his soul.
		- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) said she thinks he seems repentant, but will kill him if he tries anything devilish.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) lost her name. She read a book that wasn't supposed to and now its gone.

		- She was also banished from the Feywild.
	- [sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) said he trusts [Raven](pcs/raven.md) most so far since they've been cooking together.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) asked [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) his real name. It was Belton.
	- [sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) asked [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) how he afforded [The Second Wind](locations/the-second-wind.md).
	- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) mentioned he doesn't ever want to go back to "Doomspace".
- We reached [Kalaman](locations/kalaman.md). It was being attacked by a bunch of soldiers on dragons, draconians, and hobgoblins.
	- We intervened in the attack on the side of the locals.
