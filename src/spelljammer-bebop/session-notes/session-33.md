# Session 33 (2024-06-23)

- [Raven](raven.md) and [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) had a chat. She told him about her background. She talked about how the hardest thing about turning human is knowing how to make choices and be responsible.
	- She also let him try out some spices.
- On the deck of the ship a bunch of wizard-looking types on flying sting rays approached the ship.
	- They interrogated us on what we were doing here. They were skeptical of [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md), but [Swan](swan.md) managed to convince them to allow us to land.
	- We stowed our weapons in the portable hole and disembarked.
	- We were greeted by High Admiral Emardin Elysdar at the docks.
		- He asked us to submit to a Zone of Truth.
			- During the questioing [Myla](myla.md) came up, and Amardin said we should seek out the Shaman.
			- No violence, no defrauding.
		- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) mentioned the princess. Amardin let out that he was aware of her
		- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) asked for safe haven for his parents.
- We discussed a bit whether or not we would be cursed if we lied.
- We headed to the Elderberry Inn.
	- We ordered a massive amount of food. The bartender mentioned he was from [Eberron](eberron.md) which excited [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) - he jumped the bar and gave him a hug.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) gave [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) a hug. [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) asked us for a group hug, and then asked everyone in the bar to join. A centaur named [Zydhash](zydhash-pinevolley.md) Pinevolley joined in and then joined us for drinks.
		- [Raven](raven.md) mentioned to Zydhash about looking for the [Princess](princess-xedalli.md), i.e. [Kez](kez-bardaux.md)'s long lost girlfriend. She invited a friend, Gantar, over as he maybe knew more.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) asked Zydhash about the location of the Shaman and she shared.
	- Zydhash invited [Raven](raven.md) to her celery farm, [Swan](swan.md) joined along.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) figured out what happens to the food he eats.
