# Session 66 (2025-03-16)

- We discussed getting a tattoo.
	- [Fel](fel.md) offered us a complementary tattoo, a Mark of the Resistance

- [Fel](fel.md) asked if he could take a look at [Swan](swan.md) psychically. He went around to each of us and offered us individual tattoos.
- [Myla d'Lyrandar](myla.md) went around the group and met everyone.
- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) asked for [Fel](fel.md) to cover an old tattoo. A mark that apparently marked him as an assassin of [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md), that if read with the right tool could list the assassinations he'd done.
- [Myla d'Lyrandar](myla.md) was shocked that [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) wanted to eat a dragon.
- [Myla](myla.md) mentioned she grew up in [Sigil](sigil.md). At some point she'd gone through a door to [Pandemonium](pandemonium.md), but managed to escape.
	- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) asked if she had ever encounters [Kas](kas-the-betrayer.md), and she said she was familiar with him and his connection to Vecna.
- [Raven](raven.md) and [Swan](swan.md) went off to get their tattoos. [Swan](swan.md) asked [Raven](raven.md) for help concealing her while she was getting it done.
- [Myla](myla.md) showed [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) her dragonmark. She said that maybe she could help him find a real kraken. She mentioned a place called the Kraken Sea.
- [Fel](fel.md) mentioned that [Alustriel](alustriel-silverhand.md) has a sanctum in [Sigil](sigil.md). She meets with wizards from all over. Apparently she fused a "well of many worlds" into her sanctum and can transport people anywhere.
- [Fel](fel.md) mentioned that he was a "Dabus". A unique species to [Sigil](sigil.md).
- [Raven](raven.md) privately asked [Swan](swan.md) if she was doing okay being in [Sigil](sigil.md). She said yes, but we should keep an eye out for the door to the feywild.
- We left to go to the Smoldering Corpse. [Myla](myla.md) said she'd pay for our rooms.
- [Swan](swan.md) said that [Raven](raven.md) and her should dance to try and make [Myla](myla.md) jealous.
	- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) asked [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) to send a message to [El'a](ela.md) to she if she's doing okay.
	- [Swan](swan.md) tried to call over [Myla](myla.md) but she wanted to just talk with [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md).
	- Eventually they came over to dance, and [Swan](swan.md) pulled a move to get [Myla](myla.md) and [Raven](raven.md) dancing alone.
