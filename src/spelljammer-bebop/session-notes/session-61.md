# Session 61 (2025-01-26)

- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) convinced the Warden to leave Parsec imprisoned for a while.
	- She communicated to the rest of us that they'd meet up shortly.
	- She asked the Warden to show them the Scrub Room.
	- The scrub room cast Remove Curse and Dispel Magic on the fruit that was placed there. There was also an anti-magic field in place.
- The other group explored the door in the back of Parsec's office.
	- They dispelled a ward on the door and went down the hallway. It split in two. A golem protected the exit to the Scrub Room. Behind it [Raven](pcs/raven.md) could see what looked like a secret door that had been left ajar. The other fork went to the barracks.
	- The group returned to Parsec's office.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) requested that the group meet with the Warden and the Superintendent together to discuss something about Parsec.
	- The Warden agreed. He took the first team to the Superitendent's office and then went to fetch the second team.
- While waiting for the Warden [Raven](pcs/raven.md) explored a chest. She missed a glyph and had to use Guarded Mind to overcome the spell.
	- She took a sword, three wands, and a black skull from the chest.
	- The Warden arrived and took us to the Superintendent.
	- As we walked [Raven](pcs/raven.md) studied the Warden. It seemed like the device was what the Warden was wearing. He also seemed to have immunities to Charm, Fear, and Fire. His strongest stats were Strength and Wisdom.
	- We passed through the lab and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) swiped a necklace made of bones.
- We all arrived at the Superintenedent's office.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) told them that the inspection was satisfactory except for Parsec's behaviour. As a result we would take [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md). She didn't buy this. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) tried to talk her down from calling [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md). This failed and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) pulled out a forged doc for the prisoner transfer.
	- The Superintendent agreed to handover [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md). We returned to our ship and the Warden brought us [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md).
	- On the way out we walked past a cell where a Red Wizard was experimenting on an very large fiend in magical bindings.
	- We left [Containment Facility 53](locations/containment-facility-53.md) with [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md).
- We took a break as the ship escaped
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) shared the last of the Goodberry Wine and we celebrated. She suggested [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) check to see if the Astral Elves had infiltrated our ship or anything.
	- As [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) did he saw a dark hooded spectral figure following [Raven](pcs/raven.md).
	- We tried to identify the items to see if one of them might be cursed. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) tried to hand over the bone necklace but couldn't. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) identified the creature as undead.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) went to remove curse and the creature spoke to [Raven](pcs/raven.md) saying he'd have to kill [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) if he did. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) said they should leave it.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) tried to speak to him but he asked to have the conversation privately.
	- [Vraxil of the Twilight](npcs/vraxil-of-the-twilight.md) is his name, but we don't know that yet.
	- Necklace is made of Golden Retriever bones?
- Items
	- Black skull is spellcasting focus
	- Wand that's a spellfocus
	- Wand of Web.
		- 3 charges, gets back every day.
		- Taken by [Raven](pcs/raven.md)
	- Wand of Wonder. Taken by [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md)
	- Enspelled Short Sword +1 of Yolanda's Regal Presence. Taken by [Raven](pcs/raven.md)
- We went to speak with [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md).
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) asked him if he knew [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md) and he said yes.
	- He seemed to dislike wizards.
	- He was curious about the fungi on [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md).
	- He was skeptical of [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) and mentioned knowing [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md)'s real name.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) managed to convince him to give up [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md)'s true name.
	- He said the name is "the sounds of three acorns being crunched between teeth".
	- He asked if we could take him to The Radiant Citadel.
		- Also known as "the Place of Strangers and Stories". A floating city in Wildspace that emanates a glowing radiance around the crystal it's built around. It's an extra-planar refuge.
	- He asked for a meal and if he could chat with [Swan](pcs/swan.md) a bit.
		- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) offered to cook something.
