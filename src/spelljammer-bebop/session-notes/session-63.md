# Session 63 (2025-02-23)

- We continued the fight.
	- During the fight [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked [Vraxil](npcs/vraxil-of-the-twilight.md) for a hand. He appeared over near the portal.
	- He didn't help in combat, but afterwards said we should figure out the portal.
- We tried to enter the portal but the password [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) knew didn't work. The door started telling knock knock jokes. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) said knock knock and the portal opened.
- We went through the portal. On the other side was a beautiful savannah. We could see a colourful yurt on a nearby hill. There wasn't any sign of tracks or anything.
- We walked up to the yurt and the likeness of a tiger made of gems exited. They were [Akarran Sanger](npcs/akarran-sanger.md).
- [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) said he'd bought Akarran something.
- [Akarran](npcs/akarran-sanger.md) said "the one who speaks for us is being held captive". At the Concordant Jewel. Two individuals wearing masks (armada folk), a "dragon as if forged by the sun", and a few others.
- [Akarran](npcs/akarran-sanger.md) said he could help us get to [Sigil](locations/sigil.md), but it was through the Concordant Jewel. "Through the jewel, one can go anywhere".
- Speaker Sholeh is "the one who speaks for us".
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) why [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) has a "true name". "What is she hiding from us?"
- [Akarran](npcs/akarran-sanger.md) said the dragon is the least of our worries, its a summoned creature.
- [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) said "[Akarran Sanger](npcs/akarran-sanger.md) I've brought you a token of your long lost beloved, as requested". It was small leaf made of yellow quartz.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked the Stranger what it was about. He said it was a long story.
- [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) suspected the Armada needs the crystal to protect [The Citadel](locations/the-citadel.md) when it transported from [Xaryxispace](locations/xaryxispace.md) to Wildspace.
- [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) mentioned an old astral elf prophecy, that twins will be born to a great king under a blue star, who could ascend to godhood, but they need to ascend together.
- [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) said their real names were Sol ([Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md)) and Luna ([Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md)).
