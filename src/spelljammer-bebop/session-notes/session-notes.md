## Session 1 (2023-10-22)

- Started out at the White Galleon. In Room 13 there seems to be a summoned creature. Double Dux was the tenant. There's a reward to clear the room.
	- The Cowboy believes that Double Dux is a wizard who's not coming back. The reward is only 100gp, but we get the room contents too.
- In the room we found a spectator named Striyxits. After some discussion we found out that Double Dux has summoned him to protect the chest in the room and then left. We figured out we could destroy the chest and get him out of the contract, and now he's joining us.
- We went over to the Laughing Beholder. We met Luigi and he agreed to take on Striyxits as an apprentice.
- The Cowboy met us there and was particularly excited that we'd found a Wildspace Orrery. The one we found was connected to the "Astral Bounty System".
- We went to visit the ship. The SJ Second Wind. We met the crew and called dibs on bunks (Swan and Raven share a bunk).
- Our next bounty target is Sir Buddington Rampart III. He's on a moon of Glyth named Mingabwe. He stole a bunch of stuff from a bank.

## Session 2 (2023-10-29)

- We launched off from port. Shortly after we were attacked by some "sharks". We defeated them after a bit.
- We spent the next 12 days travelling. Raven set up a little shrine and a place to train on the deck of the ship at the bow.
- We arrived at Haven, checked in the the port authority, and then visited the Broken Whistle to look for info.
- We spoke to the bartender, but they wouldn't give up any info.
- We then spoke to a group of plasmoids and a human. The said they knew Buddington but he was on Toril. Kulgan used detect thoughts and realised they were lying. He delved deeper and the man tried to start a fight, but Kez intimidated him and he left.
- Raven and Swan were preparing to follow them as we ended.

## Session 3 (2023-11-05)

- We tailed the group out of the tavern. They split up, one going to the Port Authority, another going north, and two going east.
	- Two of the plasmoids (the lone ones) went for guards to confront Kulgan for mind-reading.
	- Swan disguised herself and started following.
	- Kulgan and Alistar were taken to the Port Authority to be interrogated for mind reading. They were let go though as there was no proof.
	- We eventually tracked them to a warehouse. Swan got in with a disguise and Raven snuck around the back. We couldn't find where the other guy went.
	- Swan caused a distraction and Raven attacked the Plasmoid from behind. We managed to knock him out.
- We went around the corner and found a pipe. As we tried to enter we were attacked by two people. We beat them after a hard fight
- We went down the tunnel, following the thieves' cant instructions to go to the right entrance.

## Session 4 (2023-11-12)

- We snuck into the first room of the hideout but it was empty and we triggered an alarm.
- We burst into the next room into an ambush. It was a tough fight and Aldrich was killed, but we prevailed in the end.
- We found some Goodberry Wine and healed ourselves.
- We fought the Buddington and defeated him. We looted the place, and returned to the ship.
- As we left we were approached by a wizard, Ravarel, looking for passage. He asked if he could join our crew.

## Session 5 (2023-11-19)

	- Raven wanted info on Double Dux. She paid an informant.
		- He went to Cullair, air planet, couple of wizards in floating rocks and stuff. Resort area for wizards.
	- Kez got a message while we were there. He didn't share it with the group.
- We ran into two guys arguing outside of Xenotermination Ltd. One of them,  Commander Vulkan, was looking for people to take down a rogue "trash compactor" (i.e. an Otyugh). The other man was Lt. Stan (owns Xenotermination), and mentioned an issue on Mingabwe.
- We went to Luigi's and ate a meal
	- He mentioned the Prince Zeloth of the Astral Elves would visit in a week.
	- The Astral elves want to build a stardock at Toril, but Prince Andrew thinks they're stepping on Bral's toes.
	- Kez and Luigi talked about Zeloth being an asshole, and that the Princess would be a better leader.
- The Cowboy mentioned a job in Krynnspace
	- A lady by the name of "Neely the Hexsnape" (sp?)

- We went into the sewers to find the Otyugh.
	- We were accosted by a Flail Snail which we killed.
	- We found a tomb and stole some stuff from a chest. Ghosts appeared and attacked us.

## Session 7 (2023-12-03)

- Going through the sewers Raven heard a group approaching. We ran back into the crypt and hid there.
- We doubled back to the spider room, but when we got there we ran into the other group. They were a merc. Brock + 4 Unknown Guild members.
	- They were out looking for the trash compactor.
	- Saxo said to talk to his boss in the Unknown Guild about selling the snail shell. He gave us a "business card". Mentioned he might be at the Rock Rat.
- We found the trash compactor and killed it, but 
- We found the HQ of the Unknown Guild. Inside was a guard named Luboar. We told him that we'd met Saxo and had a Snail shell to sell. He let us in to meet "the boss", the Unknown One. He offered us 5000gp for the shell.
	- He also offered us a job on Toril. He wants us to smuggle something to Two Stars.
	- He also asked us to "arrange a meeting" with a gentleman who had been avoiding him. A guy name Gazpacho. A gnomish wizard in the Lower City, 3 blocks from the Rock Rat Tavern. We can escort him to the Rock Rat.
	- We should reach the guild via Podol at the Rock Rat.

## Session 8 (2023-12-10)

- We rested on the ship. We asked the Cowboy about Gazpacho, but he had no info. He cautioned us about the Unknown One, but wasn't too worried about our business with him.
- We headed to the Lower City to find Gazpacho.
	- He had a bunch of traps around his house, which we set off, but we managed to talk our way in.
	- We spoke to him and persuaded him to go to the meeting (by promising to cat sit Mufffins).
	- Muffins knocked a potion off the shelf and enlarged themselves and Raven too. We managed to hold it off and feed it a reduce potion.
	- He asked to stop by his workshop on the way to the meeting.
	- We got attacked by some mechanical snakes.

## Session 9 (2023-12-17)

- We defeated the snakes. Gazpacho mentioned there being valuable items in the room with the bees, but we decided to leave it for now as we were kind of damaged.
- On the way to the Rock Rat Tavern we were accosted by 3 thieves guild members trying to get to Gazpacho, but Ravarel managed to intimidate them into leaving.
- At the Rock Rat we met the bartender Slyde. We also spotted a number of thieves guild members and the Prince lookalike from Haven.
- Kulgan went to play cards with the Thieves Guild members and at the end the leader said he knew we had Gazpacho and to hand them over. At the same time "Prince" from Haven came over to us and gave us a heads up. He seemed friendly but a bit "hippy-like".
- We fought the guild members. Raven threw down some astral caltrops and blew up the leader.
