# Session 65 (2025-03-09)

- We continued the fight, with all the enemies except the one astral elf guard still up and fighting.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) summoned the trout lord.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) managed to take out the Commander, and as she pulled out her blade the dragon disappeared.
	- We defeated the remaining creatures
- [Speaker Sholeh](npcs/speaker-sholeh.md) thanked us for the assistance.
	- She said that we would need to leave [The Radiant Citadel](locations/the-radiant-citadel.md) (alongside any other non-citizens), but could help us get where we needed.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) told her we wanted to reach [Sigil](locations/sigil.md). She asked for what sounding like a dragonshard to get us there - [Raven](pcs/raven.md) gave her the crystal with the red hair in that she had found.
- We were transported to the shop of someone named [Fel](npcs/fel.md) in [Sigil](locations/sigil.md), a friend of [Sholeh](npcs/speaker-sholeh.md).
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) announced that we were "looking for Fel". A man with dark skin and horns peaked his head out.
	- He invited us in, said he was with a customer, an that we could wait a bit.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) noticed the customer, who was getting a tattoo of a raging storm on her arm, and realised it was [Myla](npcs/myla.md).
	- [Myla](npcs/myla.md) said that it had been 15 year, [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said he had failed her.
	- She said they were on one of the trains heading out of [Metrol](locations/metrol.md). She said that [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said "he had to go".
		- She said that [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) had gone to find more comfortable seating for [Myla](npcs/myla.md).
		- She said that a guy by the name of [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md) had given him one set, and that [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said it was time for her to grow up and then [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) went to the seat.
		- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) didn't remember any of this, but didn't say so.
	- [Myla](npcs/myla.md) mentioned she was doing some sword training at a guildhall on [Sigil](locations/sigil.md).
- The group (sans Rudy) spoke a bit about the conversation. We'd heard [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md) being mentioned and were suspicious.
- We decided to get a tattoo of the symbol of a resistance, which we decided was a crescent moon and a sword.
- Dex, who worked in the shop, gave us a map of [Sigil](locations/sigil.md) and suggested we go to the Flaming Corpse to get rooms.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) heard the voice of [The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md) saying that he needed to keep [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) and [Myla](npcs/myla.md) apart.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) tried to say no and took necrotic damage.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) went into [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md)'s mind to see what is going on.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) managed to convince [The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md) to leave [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) alone for a day.
- [Myla](npcs/myla.md) asked [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) for a hug and said she was glad he'd come back.
- A woman in silver robes entered the shop.
	- She asked if we were the Resistance
	- She introduced herself as [Alustriel Silverhand](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) and requested our presence at her sanctum in the morning.
