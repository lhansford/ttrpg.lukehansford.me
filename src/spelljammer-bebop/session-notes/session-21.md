# Session 21 (2024-03-24)

- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) collected mushrooms.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) started angrily stabbing the dead manticore. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) went and joined her.
- The rest of the group moved forward and found [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md)'s body.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) destroyed the manticore eggs, but saved one. He brought it over to the group saying that if felt right to not kill it, but [Swan](pcs/swan.md) slapped it out of his hand and destroyed it.
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) casted Gentle Repose on [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md). We decided to wait until we reached the astral plane to give him a send off. We left on the Second Wind back to [Topolah](npcs/topolah.md).
- We split out the loot [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) found.
- We got back to the lighthouse. [Topolah](npcs/topolah.md)
	- Topolah recommended we do some fishing in the Astral Sea.
	- She gave us a spice pouch (made by a friend "Heward")
	- She also gave us each greater healing potions
	- She gave us one of the special locate creature potions. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) took it, but [Grimzen Gargenhale](npcs/grimzin-gargenhale.md) was not in [Realmspace](locations/realmspace.md).
	- She mentioned to visit and bring her magical ingredients so she can make us stuff.
- We left the asteroid. We travelled 5 days and reached [The Astral Sea](locations/the-astral-sea.md).
- We entered Astral Space and saw a small boat with a humanoid fishing in it.
	- He said he'd caught a couple of buckets and that his friends had left him behind.
	- He introduced himself as Slathhasss or something, but we ended up calling him Coleslaw.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) cooked sichuan barbecue fish with [sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md)'s help. It turned out real good, but extremely spicy. 
- Slaw asked [Spruce](npcs/spruce.md) if he wanted help growing, which he took offense to, but then he got interested by the fact that he can grow flowers.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) started decorating for [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md)'s funeral like it was a birthday party.
	- We all played musical instruments badly.
	- For some reason we decided to shoot Kulgan into space on a ballista.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) said we should bet on it. She tried to cheat but the rope snapped and he flew further than she bet on it.
	- We heard [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md)'s voice in our heads wishing us luck.
- Turns out we spent 28 days in Astral Space, but it felt like minutes!
- We entered [Krynnspace](locations/krynnspace.md).
- At some point [Spruce](npcs/spruce.md) said he was itchy. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) jumped off the ship with a rope attached but she got stuck in a loop on the gravity plane. As she was down there though she saw some Giant Snails crawling on to the ship.
- We managed to defeat the snails.
