# Session 54 (2024-12-08)

- Flashback to start of last session
	- Bastion turns (for [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) and [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md))
		- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) spent time in the Sacristy making a secret item.
		- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) went to the library to research soul coins and their locations. Specifically looking for the whereabouts of the soul bank in the hells. He didn't share this info with the group.
			- Where are [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md)'s personal soul coins held?
				- The vault is located in [Cania](locations/cania.md). There is a city on an icy mountain where a vault with many soul coins.
			- What would they be guarded by?
				- [Mephistopheles](npcs/mephistopheles.md) is the overlord, though doesn't personally guard it.
			- Is there a way to get a soul coin back without going to the hells?
				- Sure. Just need to make a bargain ;)
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went to talk to [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) and give him a gift. It was a shield with a face on the front of it. The intention was to help him express his feelings a bit more. The face on the shield would change based on his mood.
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) spoke with [Wyhan](npcs/wyhan.md). He expressed his misgivings about doing a heist in the [Nine Hells](locations/the-nine-hells.md). He asked if she considered the Dragon Army of [Krynn](locations/krynn.md) her enemy. She said yes. He asked if she would care about killing them to survive. [Wyhan](npcs/wyhan.md) was skeptical of hypotheticals. They debated a bit about souls. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) argued why would it be so bad to make [soul coins](other/soul-coins.md) from our enemies. [Wyhan](npcs/wyhan.md) argued that would be doing the work of [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md), not doing his own work.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) wrapped up their conversation with [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) and went to find [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Swan](pcs/swan.md).
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) chatted a bit about the gargoyles. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) said something about [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) not caring about finding allies like [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md).
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) got angry and said that was not was happening. He was upset that we made fun of him and didn't show him respect in public. This missing was extremely important to him.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) apologised. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) said he felt like nobody cares. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) said we do care, but that we prefer to be light-hearted about the situation.
- We went to visit [Kardin](npcs/kardin.md).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) looked around before entering and saw the minotaur [Alistar](npcs/alistar.md) look out the window. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) gave him a little wave.
	- [Kardin](npcs/kardin.md) said he'd sold all the spelljammers to the gargoyle.
	- He said they were no friends of [The Armada](other/xaryxian-empire.md) though.
	- He mentioned [Nozuun](npcs/nozuun.md) was the leader of the gargoyles in the area. He also mentioned being friends with the gargoyles since the last month.
	- He mentioned having an uncle who spent time in [Bral](locations/the-rock-of-bral.md).
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) didn't think it was a spell affecting the werewolves - way too powerful.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) clocked some mushrooms on the gargoyle.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) looked closer but couldn't make out much about them.
- We went to [Alistar](npcs/alistar.md)'s shop.
	- He was a little scared about us.
	- He'd retired here. The mines were supposed to be good, but everything shut down.
	- He mentioned something about the water here tasting bad.
	- He mentioned Commander [Nozuun](npcs/nozuun.md) was in the mines.
		- Has a cool hammer that [Alistar](npcs/alistar.md) would like to replicate.
- We went to another shop. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) and [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) got potions of healing. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) also got a spellcharm of pass without a trace.
- We approached the mine and discussed tactics.
	- We wanted to sneak. [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) said he had a way to check things out and cast Find Familiar. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) lept back and shouted "what the hell is that?".
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) tried to get [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) to put away the familiar. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) just kept on muttering that it's not okay. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked if everything is okay and she said no, and went invisible and went into the cave.
	- The group went into the tunnels to try and find [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and scout as well. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) split off to scout ahead. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) followed them.
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) spotted some mushroom looking dudes across a river and heard them say in his head "not so loud". They called the rest of the group to approach.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) move forward and saw three mushroomfolk and two werewolves. The werewolves seemed basically stoned. She swam across the river.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) tried to speak to the myconoids. They puffed something at Raven but she resisted it. They asked what she was doing down here and she said they were looking for a friend. The rest of the group approached but the myconoids wanted them to stay on the other side of the river. They mentioned someone hurting them and they seemed very cautious.
	- The rest of the group approached the island.
	- They mentioned Wingnut had gone to the Southern caves, and that there was a beholder with gargoyles to the Eastern caves. The Southern caves connected to the Eastern caves.
