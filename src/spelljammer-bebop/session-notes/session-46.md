# Session 46 (2024-10-06)

- We continued fighting the elementals.
	- Raven got downed immediately, but [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) healed her.
	- After a round the door at the end of the corridor opened and two werewolves holding pitchforks ran in.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) got shoved off the edge of the bridge. [Swan](swan.md) tried to get to him but her rope wasn't long enough, so [Raven](raven.md) jumped off the bridge to help him.
	- Raven managed to heal him while the others finished the fight.
- After the battle we found 4 runes on the ground. They were effectively spell scrolls.
	- One of them was a Find Familiar spell.
	- Ravarel said he'd like it and Raven said that the group should get rid of the runes and snuck away.
	- She snuck into the next room and stayed hidden. Inside where 5 werewolves and a moon dragon.
	- She informed the others
- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) summoned a familiar. A smoke mephit named Sal. He seemed annoyed that he'd been summoned.
- Swan also snuck in to see if Raven was okay.
- The rest of the group bust in. The dragon said what's up, Kez said he needs to leave, and the dragon said poppycock. He asked if "Endar" had sent us.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) convinced the dragon to tell us who Endar is. It was the dragon's nemesis, a Solar dragon. Endar kicked them off the moon they were previously inhabiting.
	- Rudy wanted to go get the solar dragon instead, but Kez thought that was a bad idea and we should just take out the moon dragon.
	- In the end we decided to fight them as we suspected the solar dragon was much more powerful.
	- The dragon mentioned that the werewolves were worshippers. They'd arrived via a portal from "Brokenstone Vale"
