# Session 34 (2024-06-30)

- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) and [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went fishing.
	- Rudy didn't have much success, but eventually they managed to land a tuna.
- [Swan](swan.md) and [Raven](raven.md) had a chat.
	- [Swan](swan.md) mentioned she might have a crush on [Kez](kez-bardaux.md).
- We sold the flute, 1500gp each.
- We headed to the portal tree.
	- As we approached an elf hidden in the trees whispered to us. It was Gantar
	- He mentioned there's a demiplane hidden in the tree, and that the princess might be there.
	- He asked us to pass on a petition.
	- We entered the tree but encountered a bunch of enemies who had taken out the dryads protecting the tree. They said something like "two birds with one stone, its another bounty!"
