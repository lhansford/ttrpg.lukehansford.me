# Session 51 (2024-11-17)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) went to speak with the [Princess](npcs/princess-xedalli.md).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) questioned what her opinion was on what to do with her brother. She was of the opinion that forgiveness and redemption was possible, but highly unlikely, and killing her brother was likely what was needed.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) also spoke a bit about her following of Ilmater and how she sometimes has trouble knowing her action will cause more or less suffering in the long run.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) and [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) got into a conversation.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) was considering the best use of his wildshape. He didn't feel comfortable changing to an animal.
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) mentioned how he came from a rich cattle farming family. He also mentioned he was expelled from his school after he and his friends used forbidden magic.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) talked about having a party for the group. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) started pulling patches of his coat to decorate for a party. He pulled out a ladder and a bag of gold.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) apologised to [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) for not communicating what she wanted to do.
	- Swan also raised that she was concerned about [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md)'s aggression when using Hullbreaker. They came up with a a code word to get Rudy to calm down - "Nougaty".
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went to talk to [Raven](pcs/raven.md) about having a party.
	- While they were talking the mindflayers contacted [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and told her they'd been hijacked by [Neogi](other/neogi.md) and asked for assistance.
- We found the Mindflayer's ship and approached. There were no creatures in sight. We entered the main door on the deck and found 3 [Neogi](other/neogi.md).
	- During the fight the lead [Neogi](other/neogi.md) cast Disintegration on Rudy and destroyed his sword.
