# Session 68 (2025-03-30)

- We returned to the Smouldering Corpse. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) dropped back a bit to make sure we weren't being followed.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) told the team it wasn't [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md). We discussed next options.
	- We decided that we would tell [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) about fake Tasha, and say we will go after the chimes.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) confronted [Myla](npcs/myla.md) about [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md). She insisted that she knew nothing, as did Rudy.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) tried to cast Find Familiar, but the spell failed. We realised that you can't summon things on [Sigil](locations/sigil.md).
- We told [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) that [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) wasn't who she was. [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) didn't seem convinced at first, but she came to our side.
- We decided to lay a trap for fake [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md). [Swan](pcs/swan.md) transformed into her true form and [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) summoned [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md).
- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) didn't seem to recognise [Swan](pcs/swan.md). [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) confronted her, and she tried to leave, but [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) grabbed her. She transformed into [Kas the Betrayer](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md).
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) tried to detect thoughts and could see that he was using a crown to change himself.
	- During the fight [Swan](pcs/swan.md) demanded to [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md) "Where is my mother?!"
	- We managed to defeat [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md), and all that was left behind was a strange looking crown.
