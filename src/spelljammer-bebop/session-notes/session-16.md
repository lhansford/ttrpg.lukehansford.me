# Session 16 (2024-02-18)

- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) started negotiating with [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md)
	- He asked for quite a lot of money, which [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) outright rejected.
	- We agreed on exchanging the knife for the prisoners + a cart.
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) was about to agree on it, but [Raven](pcs/raven.md) jumped in to ask for safe passage as well. [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) joked about us ruining her sport.
	- She agreed on it if we shared info.
		- [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) was [Double Dux](dubbuldux.md)'s master, but she "got too close" in her words. She refused to join him in Wildspace. Her loyalty to the [Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md) was "stronger than her love for Double D". [Double Dux](dubbuldux.md) stole her blade.
		- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) told [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) that we had found the blade in a box in the haunted house. She lied that it was in the bedroom where we found the trapped spellbook.
- [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) asked us why we were interested in [Double Dux](dubbuldux.md).
	- She offered us 9000gp if we bring her the head of Double Dux.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) why there was an astral elf with her.
	- She said that would require a lot more info from us.
	- She let the group go and gave us our things.
	- She said that she has business with the [Xaryxian Empire](other/xaryxian-empire.md). [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked what and she mentioned that the [Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md) have a small fleet and would like to have a bigger presence outside of [Toril](locations/toril.md).
		- She mentioned their might be a small [Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md) enclave on [Bral](locations/the-rock-of-bral.md).
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) swore that he would kill [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md).
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) told [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) that he might consider joining [The Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md).
- [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) departed and we headed back to [The Second Wind](other/the-second-wind.md). [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) gave the cart renter the gold [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md) gave us.
- We got back to [The Second Wind](other/the-second-wind.md) and told [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) about the bounty we got on [Double Dux](dubbuldux.md).
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) shared the [Manual of the Planes](other/manual-of-the-planes.md) with the crew which they were excited about.
- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) mentioned to [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) that [Lt. Stan](npcs/lt-stan.md) is secretly a very good illustrator.
- We left [Toril](locations/toril.md) and headed back to [Bral](locations/the-rock-of-bral.md).
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) asked the [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) about the Create Spelljamming Helm spell.
	- We figured out maybe the haunted house had a bunch of spelljamming helms there.
	- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) and [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) wanted to go back to get them, but we decided it'd be safer to let the heat die down first.
	- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) also mentioned a potential red wizard enclave on [Bral](locations/the-rock-of-bral.md), but was suprised to here about their dealings with [The Armada](other/xaryxian-empire.md).
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) mentioned he has a meeting with [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md).
	- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) was surprised. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) told him they grew up together. His mother worked at the Citadel and that's where he grew up and was trained.
- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) asked to borrow the [Manual of the Planes](other/manual-of-the-planes.md). [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) was also interested. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) suggested creating a library. [Del](npcs/captain-del.md) said to ask [Spruce](npcs/spruce.md), [Spruce](npcs/spruce.md) was very unkeen on the idea. He said we could have one bookshelf and we can't call it a library. [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) suggested we call it a "book prison".
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) read the [Manual of the Planes](other/manual-of-the-planes.md) and learnt about "Ringspace" and space clowns ðŸ¤¡.
- We got back to [Bral](locations/the-rock-of-bral.md).
- [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) invited [Del](npcs/captain-del.md) to join him for a meal.
	- They went to [The Laughing Beholder](locations/the-laughing-beholder.md). The meal got off to a rocky start though.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) wanted to go buy a magic weapon.
	- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) recommend going to [Yarnak's Dwarven Arms](locations/yarnaks-dwarven-arms.md).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) joined him to try and sell some weapons.
	- The owner offered a magical spear to [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md). It was a very cool spear that exploded and returns
		- He got a discount, but we need to return with a palette of [Mingabwe](locations/mingabwe.md) cold steel.
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) went off to sell the magic scrolls.
	- He sold the scrolls and got a couple of new ones.
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) went to find [Lt. Stan](npcs/lt-stan.md).
	- [Lt. Stan](npcs/lt-stan.md) said he's no good with a brush, but [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) persisted. He eventually admitted to it.
