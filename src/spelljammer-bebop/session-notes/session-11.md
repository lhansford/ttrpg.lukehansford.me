# Session 11 (2024-01-14)

- We arrived at the docks of [mulsantir](locations/mulsantir.md). Most of the group went to find transport, Raven and Swan went to gather intel on the road to [two-stars](locations/two-stars.md).
	- We got the cart and horse for two days
	- Raven met a dwarf who mentioned a haunted house halfway up to Two Stars. He also mentioned discount magic items outside the town.
- On the way out of Mulsantir we went to the magic items shop. It was run by a Red Wizard of the Enclave. We bought a bunch of stuff. **Swan purchased a 1000gp ring for Raven.**  It was all a bit sketchy. The wizard ([borgol-kirdis](npcs/borgol-kirdis.md)) has a quasit familiar who Raven questioned about how it was treated.
- We stopped to rest near the haunted house and decided to go investigate. In it we discovered and fought a bunch of skeletons.
