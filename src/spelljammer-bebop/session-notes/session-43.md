# Session 43 (2024-09-15)

- We left the moon with [Admiral Warwick](admiral-warwick.md).
- [Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md) wanted us to take Warwick to Vodonispace, where his mercenary group is.
	- She wants to speak to he master of the merc group, Master Warburton Weatherby.
	- They're in [Port Drogheda](port-drogheda.md)
	- Vodoni Prime might be a good place to get some more firepower.
- She also mentioned doing a bit of subterfuge in [Xaryxispace](xaryxispace.md).
	- We could find this "Stranger" and learn Raphael's true name.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went fishing and caught some glowing crabs. [Raven](raven.md) made a kimchi soup and he made some crab cakes.
- [Swan](swan.md) went and threw some daggers. [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md) came and chatted a bit. She talked about buying more books.
	- Vera asked her about the Feywild, which shocked Swan. Vera's parents would use fey magic, which is why she was curious. She'd like to learn more.
- Swan asked Raven if she felt different in anyway and mentioned it was cool she could make people fall over now.
- Raven crafted a component pouch for [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md).
- We took about 3 weeks to get to [Vodoni Prime](vodoni-prime.md)
- Along the way we got pulled out of spelljamming speed by another ship.
	- The ship had a mouth of jagged teeth.
