# Session 69 (2025-04-06)

- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) scooped up the ashes of [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md) into a magic jar to prevent him from reviving.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) picked up the crown (in case it was cursed), and [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) identified it.
	- It was the [Crown of Lies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8419440-crown-of-lies).
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) asked if she could have it, in exchange for gold. We agreed.
	- She said something cryptic about sensing something about [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md).
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) followed [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) to her office and asked her "Where is mother?"
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) asked [Swan](pcs/swan.md) how she got on [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md)'s bad side. She told her how she had imitated the Baba Yaga. She tormented some mushroom people, but they banded together and defeated her, which angered [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md). She also lost a Ring of Wishing.
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) mentioned she was concerned the Crown of Lies might have sentience or something malevolent behind it.
- [Myla](npcs/myla.md) and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) spoke about returning to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md). They asked [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) to ask [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) to take care of [Myla](npcs/myla.md) while we finished our mission.
- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) sent a message to [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md).
	- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) responded, mentioning something about [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md) putting her in a prison, and something about "crimson".
- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) gave [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) a book called "The Red Prison". She said that's where [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) is probably kept, "in its endless void".
	- She said she'd need time to figure out how to let us get back.
	- The prison is on another plane. She'd need to take some time to figure out which layer [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) is on.
	- She suggested we retrieve the chimes first. They reside in the heart of a dead god, Havoc. There's a crashed Githyanki ship there with a portal on it that we could travel to.
- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) gave us 4000gp each for the Crown of Lies.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) spoke to [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) about looking after [Myla](npcs/myla.md). She said it be okay. He also asked about travelling to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md).
- We went and did a quick shop.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) changed her appearance to have vibrant indigo eye, blonde and red streaks in her hair, and a green velvet robe with sylvan embroidery. She thanked the group for allowing her to be who she wants to be.
- We went through the portal to the husk of the dead god.
	- We travelled a bit and were attacked by four giant angler fish.
