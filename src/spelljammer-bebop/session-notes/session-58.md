# Session 58 (2025-01-05)

- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) revived. He mentioned having seen [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) sniffed [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) and he smelt strongly mushroomy. His crest had also changed colour and consistency.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) mentioned the waiting room.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) if he experienced the same thing, but he had only experienced a cold dark void.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked if he felt any different, but [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) said no. He also seemed to suggest he didn't realise that he'd agreed to a deal. The mushroom chimed in and said he'd consented and "you will serve us well". And later on "[The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md) and the lizard are entwined."
- We left the cave system.
- We visited [Alistar](npcs/alistar.md) to give him [Nozuun](npcs/nozuun.md)'s hammer.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) asked [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) to give him the hammer because he think [Alistar](npcs/alistar.md) didn't like him much.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) gave him the hammer for free.
	- They group mentioned that they'd dealt with the beholder in the mines.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) broke off from the group and went to stable. We took some dire wolves, attached them to the cart Floyd the gargoyle was passed out on, and sent him off into the wilderness.
- We went to the tavern.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) got overcome by a feeling (failed save). He went up to Ernst, the other gargoyle in the bar, and intimidated him into leaving (in a very weird way).
	- We returned Wingnut to [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md). She was very grateful and asked to come to our ship.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) got to talking to [W.U.L.F.](npcs/wulf.md). She said his name was cool and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) should have a cool name like that. He asked Rudy what his name stood for and Rudy told him. He recognised that it was from [Metrol](locations/metrol.md).
- We returned to the ship and got some rest
- ***Level up***
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) went to check on [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) in the workshop.
	- She mentioned talking a lot with [Big Mac](npcs/big-mac.md) and was interested in upgrading the laser cannon.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) told her that there's a smithy she could use too.
	- [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) asked him how he'd ended up here. He mentioned being from [Metrol](locations/metrol.md). [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) asked what year, and he responded 994YK.
		- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) mentioned his employer was the leader of a house.
		- On the day he remembers the leader came to him and sent him and [Myla](npcs/myla.md) on the lightning-rail out of [Metrol](locations/metrol.md).
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) mentioned needing to get to [Sigil](locations/sigil.md) to find [Myla](npcs/myla.md).
	- [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) mentioned a friend in [Sigil](locations/sigil.md), a tiefling named [Fel](npcs/fel.md) who runs a tattoo parlour.
	- [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) talked about how she wanted to go back to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md) as well, but hadn't found a way.
		- She gave [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) a pewter necklace, with a House Cannith symbol on it. She said it was from [Metrol](locations/metrol.md) and might help him return home.
	- She asked what was up with [Raven](pcs/raven.md).
		- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said that above all [Raven](pcs/raven.md) is a good friend.
		- [Kylana](npcs/kylana-ir-cannith.md) asked if [Raven](pcs/raven.md) was interested in her and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said well she does have your hair.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) went with [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) to try and figure out a cure for the werewolves.
	- They managed to create a solution that could be put in a keg to cure them all.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) sought out [El'a](npcs/ela.md), but grunted at her and went to his room.
	- She went to see what was up and he said that he was thinking of resigning as captain. He felt not up to it and that he was making the wrong choices.
	- She asked him "are captains supposed to be perfect"?
	- She mentioned that her brother was a "book person". He has a saying, "the only person you're really responsible for is yourself".
	- She said that we seem like a bunch of people with a lot of emotional turmoil and that discussing things a bit more would maybe be helpful.
	- They roleplayed a bit trying to discuss feeling. [El'a](npcs/ela.md) told him not to crinkle his eyes when people ask to speak to him.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) said he's an astral elf and that's just how it is. [El'a](npcs/ela.md) mentioned she was born in a noble house in [Waterdeep](locations/waterdeep.md), but she skipped town and went to the Spelljammer Academy. Just because people say he should be something doesn't mean he needs to be.
	- They ended up playing dice together.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went to the garden. He dug his feet into the earth and started speaking primordial and asked "anything you need me to do?". He got a reply "I'll know it when I see it."
	- The voice said it like the garden. They had a long conversation together and went fishing.
	- The voice said "you can't go and die like that. you have to listen to me. your interest is my interest."
	- "We've got a mission [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md), and I need you alive for it, and you need me alive for it."
	- "I'm to worried about any space elves. I need to find a girl, well, a young woman...She's part of the prophecy, but I can't disclose any more than that."
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) asked where they should look and the voice read a poem. The poem mentioned [Myla](npcs/myla.md). [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) said he'd heard that name and the voice said not to mention this to [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md).
	- He went fishing, caught a fish, and appears that the voice cast a spell on him to throw the fish back.
- [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) asked us to talk to [Kardin](npcs/kardin.md) and then return so we could make our next move.
	- We went down and communicated with him (above table it was abstracted).
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) tried to convince [W.U.L.F.](npcs/wulf.md) to join us. He was hesitant to join, but decided to.
- [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) showed us a map of [Containment Facility 53](locations/containment-facility-53.md)
	- Part prison, part laboratory for powerful magical creatures.
	- [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md) was imprisoned there.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked if there was other people we might want to free there.
		- There's a rumour that [Prince Andy](npcs/prince-andy.md) is held there.
	- People enter through the Main Entrance when invited. There's arcane doors separating the rooms.
	- There's also a prison transport entrance, but people have to go through the scrub room first which will wipe out any magical effects.
	- There are four core rooms that contain magical crystals that fuel the facility. They also act as a killswitch - if a breach is imminent they have instructions to self-destruct.
	- Lots of traps, lots of sensors, glyphs, golems and drones, and a number of high-level wizards.
	- Sources say there are 6 individuals of interest calling the place home:
		- General Thaylinn, the superintendent of the prison.
			- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) knew this person as highly ruthless and highly unethical.
		- Warden Golmook
			- Yakfolk hailing from [Toril](locations/toril.md). A dreadful warlord. Single handedly took down a colony of fire giants.
		- Highmage Valray. A Xyraxian mage.
		- Associate Warden Parsek. An arcanaloth, with powerful magic.
		- Vaskir ???, a human from [Toril](locations/toril.md). Second in command to a Zulkir, a Red Wizard of Thay.
		- [Dubbuldux](npcs/dubbuldux.md). 
	- We have two weeks to arrive there (two bastion turns).
