# Session 53 (2024-12-01)

- We discussed Bastion rules and selected some special facilities:
	- Rudy picked: Smithy, Trophy Room.
	- Raven picked: Sanctuary, Laboratory
	- Kez picked: Training Area, Workshop
	- Swan picked: Theater, Greenhouse
	- Tentative picks:
		- Ravarel: Arcane Study, Teleportation Circle
		- Slathasss: Garden, Sacristy
		- Library
- We took a bastion turn on the way to [Zalani](zalani.md).
	- [Big Mac](big-mac.md) got caught out on a bounty for blowing someones thumb off. [Swan](swan.md) paid 500gp.
	- Otherwise, all was well.
- We headed to [Lycanvine](lycanvine.md) in [The Bloodfrenzy](sj-bloodfrenzy.md)
	- We know that the Lycanthropes were once allies with the fleet, but they were betrayed and aren't friendly anymore.
	- We docked with a tower that had been built to dock spelljammers.
	- We went to the tavern in search of [Kardin](kardin.md).
		- The bartender was a warforged dressed as a wolf. Their name was [W.U.L.F.](wulf.md)
		- The bartender said [Kardin](kardin.md) was at the rookery.
		- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) chatted with a guy named [Smoof](smoof.md). They were an ettercap.
		- We saw a gargoyle (Floyd) bossing around 3 werewolves.
			- [Raven](raven.md) grabbed a bottle of wine and went over to them. The Gargoyle said the werewolves were their servants, but then he went for a bathroom break.
			- [Raven](raven.md) tried to speak to the werewolves, but they seemed to be under some sort of compulsion or something, and insisted that everything was cool.
		- [Smoof](smoof.md) mentioned that after the last 3 weeks the werewolves are just doing whatever the gargoyles do, even though they're previously enemies.
		- We meet someone named [Kylana](kylana-ir-cannith.md)
			- She's a captain of a space galleon that got attacked by the space shark.
			- [Raven](raven.md) got a bit of a crush on her.
			- She mentioned that there was a cave near the town that people were being secretive about. She sent her homunculus Wingnut to explore but they hadn't come back.
				- She mentioned needing a gem of some sort to fix Wingnut. Raven pulled out a piece of quartz that had some red hair stuck in it. She had found it when fighting the manticores. Turns out that maybe it was [Kylana](kylana-ir-cannith.md)'s hair, but we didn't explore that more.
			- She was from [Eberron](eberron.md) via [Sigil](sigil.md). She mentioned a portal at the edge of [Vodonispace](vodonispace.md).
			- She mentioned being an artificer and started talking about creating repeating crossbows, but got cut off.
			- We agreed to have a dinner party with Udon Noodles and Cake.
