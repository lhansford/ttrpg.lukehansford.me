# Session 53 (2024-12-01)

- We discussed Bastion rules and selected some special facilities:
	- Rudy picked: Smithy, Trophy Room.
	- Raven picked: Sanctuary, Laboratory
	- Kez picked: Training Area, Workshop
	- Swan picked: Theater, Greenhouse
	- Tentative picks:
		- Ravarel: Arcane Study, Teleportation Circle
		- Slathasss: Garden, Sacristy
		- Library
- We took a bastion turn on the way to [Zalani](zalani.md).
	- Big Mac got caught out on a bounty for blowing someones thumb off. Swan paid 500gp.
	- Otherwise, all was well.
- We headed to Lycanvine in the SJ Bloodfrenzy
	- We know that the Lycanthropes were once allies with the fleet, but they were betrayed and aren't friendly anymore.
	- We docked with a tower that had been built to dock spelljammers.
	- We went to the tavern in search of Kardin.
		- The bartender was a warforged dressed as a wolf.
		- The bartender said Kardin was at the rookery.
		- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) chatted with a guy named Smoof. They were an ettercap.
		- We saw a gargoyle bossing around 3 werewolves.
			- Raven grabbed a bottle of wine and went over to them. The Gargoyle said the werewolves were their servants, but then he went for a bathroom break.
			- Raven tried to speak to the werewolves, but they seemed to be under some sort of compulsion or something, and insisted that everything was cool.
		- Smoof mentioned that after the last 3 weeks the werewolves are just doing whatever the gargoyles do, even though they're previously enemies.
		- We meet someone named [Kylana](kylana.md)
			- She's a captain of a space galleon that got attacked by the space shark.
			- Raven got a bit of a crush on her.
			- She mentioned that there was a cave near the town that people were being secretive about. She sent her homunculus Wingnut to explore but they hadn't come back.
				- She mentioned needing a gem of some sort to fix Wingnut. Raven pulled out a piece of quartz that had some red hair stuck in it. She had found it when fighting the manticores. Turns out that maybe it was Kylana's hair, but we didn't explore that more.
			- She was from Eberron via Sigil. She mentioned a portal at the edge of [Vodonispace](vodonispace.md).
			- She mentioned being an artificer and started talking about creating repeating crossbows, but got cut off.
			- We agreed to have a dinner party with Udon Noodles and Cake.
