# Session 56 (2024-12-22)

- *I missed the first 2 hours of the game, but the jist was that they beat Commander [Nozuun](npcs/nozuun.md), found out that the gargoyles had summoned some sort of fungal beholder, and they were now exploring to find that creature. I joined in as they were fighting a bunch of fungus monsters.*
- We managed to defeat the creatures.
- We explored futher ahead. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) scouted ahead and spotted 6 fungi guys and [Kaxanathranazan](npcs/kaxanathranazan.md) hiding in the ceiling.
- We tried to parley with [Kaxanathranazan](npcs/kaxanathranazan.md), but he wasn't happy that we'd killed [Nozuun](npcs/nozuun.md) who had apparently saved him from The Abyss (Shaddonon perhaps, but I don't remember clearly).
	- Raven snuck some of the liquid coming off it and quickly tested it to identify that it was the cause of the werewolves' malady.
