# Session 18 (2024-03-03)

- The guard stabbed [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) and then dashed away. As he did we saw that he looked like [Prince Andy](npcs/prince-andy.md).
	- [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) cast Suggestion on the assassin and asked him to sit at his feet and answer all his questions.
	- Two of the servants also transformed into [Prince Andy](npcs/prince-andy.md) lookalikes.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) told [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) that our price to help him is tripled.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) killed one of the fake Andy's and it transformed into a doppelganger.
	- Real [Prince Andy](npcs/prince-andy.md) was trying to flee and [Gadaric](npcs/gadaric-main.md) tried to stop him, saying that the ruler should stay and fight.
- At the end of the fight, Kulgan interrogated the captive. He said that Prince Andy had hired the dopplegangers to kill [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md). Andy denied this but fled with [Gadaric](npcs/gadaric-main.md). Kulgan wanted to Detect Thoughts on the captive, but [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) stopped him.
	- Kez and Kulgan had a secret convo about how Kez knows the Prince is up to something dodgy, but doesn't want us all getting killed because of it.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) asked for glamoured armor from Xeleth, he said he'd have it delivered.
- We left the Palace.
	- Kez asked us all to speak after we'd gotten far enough away.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) was very concerned about [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md)'s plans. We think the spy he wanted us to kill is his sister.
	- Kez say that [Gadaric](npcs/gadaric-main.md) is a member of the [Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md).
	- Kez thinks we have 3 issues:
		- We need to get the assassin back
		- We need to rescue the princess
		- We should probably rescue Prince Andy or make sure he doesn't die.
- We decided to not get the assassin back as it seemed very risky.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) wanted to go get some clothes tailored that look like [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md)'s.
	- The proprietor, Finn, was on to us that we were up to no good. We told him we're running a scam and we'd cut him in. 10 days, 300gp.
- As [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) arrived back at the ship there was a delivery with [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) with armor and a sword.
