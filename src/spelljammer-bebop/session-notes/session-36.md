# Session 36 (2024-07-21)

- We realised the high shaman was still alive and fed him a potion.
	- He told us that the portal was something of a decoy, and that the mercenaries probably didn't use it correctly.
	- The real portal leads to both [Sigil](locations/sigil.md) and a hiding place.
	- He asked us what assurances we could give that we wouldn't harm the [Princess](npcs/princess-xedalli.md).
		- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) offered him an old sylvan word of promise.
	- The shaman activated the real portal. The floor of the tree transformed into a lake and he asked us to jump.
		- We all jumped.
		- As we came up above the water we were in a different place, a small elven village.
- As we arrived in the village we met 3 people. [The High Admiral](npcs/emardin-elysdar.md), Lady Emara Tandris, and [Princess Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md). 
	- The [Princess](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) mentioned that [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) intended to use "the light of Xaraxys" to transport [The Citadel](locations/the-citadel.md) to [Realmspace](locations/realmspace.md).
	- She questioned our intentions individually.
		- She asked Raven about her eyes and said something poetic. Raven told her she was from the Feywild.
- The [Princess](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) said that we alone couldn't stop [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md), and that we'd need to build an alliance of space-faring people.
	- She mentioned that she "had in a friend in the clock" that she wanted us to talk to, gesturing to the grandfather clock in the room.
	- She opened the clock and inside was glowing blue staircase. It was [The Infinite Staircase](other/the-infinite-staircase.md).
- We went down the staircase to a large domed room. Inside their appeared to be a feast going on, with elementals and other creatures around. We also spotted [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md), the strange Prince-looking dude we'd met before.
	- Turns out [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md) is a genie.
	- This place was called the "Censor of Dreams".
	- He took us to the "Well of Destiny"
		- Inside we could hear people's wishes
		- We heard the wish that the Cowboy wanted retired and [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md) told us he was ready.
		- He mentioned that in Bral their's an individual named "Vokath" at the "? Agency". He builds spelljammers. He helps out people in Athaspace who are trying to escape. He wishes for "a great might" for his upcoming "bloodsport arena".
		- He told us that there's a pathway to Bral from the stairs.
	- If we even see a door with an eye surrounded by 8 more eyes then that's a path to the staircase.
- We rested and the [Princess](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) came to greet us.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) got in an argument, first about fighting in the arena, but then about Swan killing the manticore egg.
	- We then got on to talking about the vampirates the [Princess](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) had associated with. The fangs are just for show, but they're undead, more like energy vampires.
	- She mentioned [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) wants to control all spaces.
		- She also mentioned [Szass Tamm](npcs/szass-tamm.md) was working with him.
		- But also the opposing Red Wizards on New Eltibar.
		- Xeleth will destroy the star in [Xaryxispace](locations/xaryxispace.md) to harness the energy to move  [The Citadel](locations/the-citadel.md). Doing so will destroy all the planets and colonies there.
		- [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) would rather dissolve the Elven Armada and give people the chance to migrate out of [Xaryxispace](locations/xaryxispace.md) peacefully.
- Xedalli learnt the [Swan](pcs/swan.md) doesn't know her name, and said that it's a "barrier to a potential ally".
