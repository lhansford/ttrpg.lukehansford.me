# Session 27 (2024-05-12)

- We decided to split up. [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) delivered the forged letter to [Dovghest Arguhl](npcs/dovghest-arghul.md) informing him of his son's death. The rest of us snuck up to the keep.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md), [Swan](pcs/swan.md), [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md), and [sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) climbed the wall and saw some sort of ritual going on in the courtyard.
	- [Dovghest Arguhl](npcs/dovghest-arghul.md) mentioned that the wand allowed him to "go somewhere else".
		- He mentioned he was a Red Wizard, but had been exiled from Thay.
		- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) told him that he had been to [Mulsantir](locations/mulsantir.md) and [Two Stars](locations/two-stars.md) and had dealings with [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md).
			- Dovghest called her a "loyalist".
		- Dovghest's bodyguard was called "Dusk".
		- Dovghest dimension doored into the keep with [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md)
	- The stealthers opened a door an ran into the dragonfolk who escaped our last encounter.
- Fight started, yadda yadda, death dragon summoned.
