# Session 25 (2024-04-21)

- [Swan](swan.md) and [Raven](raven.md) snuck up on the encampment, but [Swan](swan.md) was spotted.
	- She tied to fake just looking for food, but the Draconian didn't seem fooled and [Raven](raven.md) popped open her smoking bottle.
	- A fight started. During the fight [Swan](swan.md) freed [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md).
	- We defeated the draconians, but their leader dimension doored away.
- We gave Vera some healing and spoke with her a bit.
- [Swan](swan.md) was surprised by her new echo.
- [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md) seemed suspicious of Lord Barakis
	- She didn't want to take part in the war and just wanted to leave.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) asked about [Wyhan](wyhan.md). Vera said she was in a bad mood, something about competition in town undercutting her. Bakaris switched over the army needs to the new guys.
		- "Just because its cheaper, doesn't mean you can turn your back."
	- [Raven](raven.md) wanted to take Vera on the ship. She asked her a bunch of questions. [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) was highly skeptical.
	- The wizards undercutting [Wyhan](wyhan.md) are Thayans.
		- Led by "Dovghest"
		- Shop boy named "Heshod", seems okay.
			- Vera got friendly with him.
			- Son of Dovghest maybe?
	- Turns out she was planning on running. Heshod was going to open a portal. He was going to take them to Eltebar in Thay.
		- Heshod was killed by Draconians. They group of 4 scouts was jumped by draconians and taken to a keep to be questioned.
		- Moduda, the blue draconian, executed Heshod because he wouldn't talk.
		- Vera broke out the rest of the group, but they got caught eventually.
	- We offered to take Vera on the ship.
