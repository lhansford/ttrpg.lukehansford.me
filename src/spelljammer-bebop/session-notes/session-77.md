# Session 77 (2025-06-01)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) investigated [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md)'s prison. It seemed to need some sort of magical key, that [Kerkermeister](npcs/kerkermeister.md) likely had.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) communed with [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) and took on some of her powers.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) manage to down [Kerkermeister](npcs/kerkermeister.md) and grab the keys. As he died he exploded and killed [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md). [Raven](pcs/raven.md) revived him with a scroll of revivify.
- We managed to defeat all the demons.
