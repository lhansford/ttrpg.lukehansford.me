# Session 57 (2024-12-29)

- We started a fight with [Kaxanathranazan](npcs/kaxanathranazan.md).
	- We managed to take down the small guys, but Kax kept jumping around.
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) was hit by a "ray of decay" and was disintegrated into a pile of leaves. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) managed to revive him with the spellcharm we found in the mines.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) also got hit by the ray of decay and was killed.
	- We managed to take down [Kaxanathranazan](npcs/kaxanathranazan.md).
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went to a waiting room where there was a talking fox.
	- The fox suggested he go to visit [Celestian](npcs/celestian.md) to take him to the afterlife.
	- On the journey he encountered [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md) who offered him a deal.
	- They walked for a while. At some point [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md) rocked up and told Raphael to "get the fuck out of here man".
- We found Wingnut in a side cave. They couldn't move but could talk to us. They warned us of the beholder shaped object. [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) picked them up and we left.
- We went to talk to the party mushrooms. They thanked us for dealing with the beholder. They said they could maybe revive [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) him, but he'd be part of the "sovereign".
- The mushrooms gave [Raven](pcs/raven.md) an item that could commune with the spirits. She asked if [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) would like to be revived but be part of a hive mind.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) said "sure". [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md) acted as the messenger.
	- We asked what it was like there. He responded "Quiet", but the Spirit Board just said "Uncertain".
	- For the last question [Raven](pcs/raven.md) just said "I'm sorry for running away, you need to come back so we can discuss". On the other side though [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md) just said "oh, that message is for someone else".
- We started communing in a circle. Each of the party said words to encourage him back.
	- When [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) spoke a vision of [Myla](npcs/myla.md) appeared on the otherside to [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) to communicate his message.
- At the end the Spirit Board spelled out the letters to [raven](pcs/raven.md)'s last question - "YOU WERE ALWAYS FREE"
