# Session 14 (2024-02-04)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) picked up the magic rods from the house to close the secret entrance.
- Campfire chat
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) confronted [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) about his behaviour towards [Raven](pcs/raven.md). He denied anything and said he's not interested in relationships.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) mentioned that he's starting to have dreams and never experienced that on [Eberron](locations/eberron.md)
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) about [The Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md)
	- Raven read through the books.
		- [The Infinite Staircase](other/the-infinite-staircase.md) by the [Archmage Mento Chef](npcs/archmage-mento-chef.md).
			- Explains the infinite staircase stretches to every plane. A big secret only few know about. A way to travel the multiverse. A series of demiplanes that creates a thread across planes. Within are doorways to planes.
			- Very few people would have access and you would need almost god like power to share the knowledge of it with others.
			- Entrances in [Realmspace](locations/realmspace.md)
				- Near a griffon nest on Mount [Waterdeep](locations/waterdeep.md)
				- A hallway in [Stardock](locations/stardock.md)  in [The Tears of Selune](locations/the-tears-of-selune.md).
				- [The Starhaven Palace](locations/the-starhaven-palace.md) on [Bral](locations/the-rock-of-bral.md)
			- Talks about different planes
				- Abbys
					- A demon named [Grazzit](npcs/grazzit.md)
				- Feywild
		- [Manual of the Planes](other/manual-of-the-planes.md)
			- See image
			- Handy for spelljamming to other locations
		- An Unknown Sphere by [Double Dux](npcs/double-dux.md)
			- Likely referring to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md)
			- The Sphere of Dragons
				- Believed travel to and from this sphere is impossible
				- Thinks it might be possible to travel there via [Sigil](locations/sigil.md) or some other esoteric means
				- Rumoured [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) can dream a group of people there.
					- Dealing with [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) is fraught with danger
				- There is a man/dragon named [Ames](npcs/ames.md) that might know how to get there too
				- Spelljamming ships cannot get there.
					- [Hallister](npcs/hallister-blackcloak.md) captured a [Spelljammer](other/spelljammer.md) (squid class) and studied it to see if it was possible, but figured it couldn't.
				- "Long live [Szass Tamm](npcs/szass-tamm.md)" - sign off on book, hard to tell [Double Dux](npcs/double-dux.md)'s position on them though.
- We travelled towards [Two Stars](locations/two-stars.md). There were dark clouds to the East. We reached there near sunset. We went and found the Two Stars Tavern.
	- Raven failed hard at finding [Edgin](npcs/edgin-darvis.md). Kulgan went to sweet talk the barkeep.
	- The barkeep pointed out [Edgin](npcs/edgin-darvis.md) and he asked us to come with him to his house. Swan and Raven trailed behind a bit to keep an eye out for any followers.
- At [Edgin](npcs/edgin-darvis.md)'s house we unloaded the crates. He mentioned they were for [The Wychlaran](other/the-wychlaran.md) of [Rashemen](locations/rashemen.md). He paid us 500gp
- [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) started talking about [Lady Luck](npcs/lady-luck.md) and it freaked out Edgin and he revoked the invite to stay at his house.
	- Raven clocked Edgin thought it was the devil he was talking about.
- Raven threatened to slit his throat if anyone innocent got hurt.
	- Edgin spilt his guts about being a member of the [Harpers](other/harpers.md) and getting the wands to help [The Wychlaran](other/the-wychlaran.md) fight [The Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md).
	- He mentioned the [Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md) might have access to a  [spelljammer](other/spelljammer.md).
- [Edgin](npcs/edgin-darvis.md) also mentioned [Double Dux](npcs/double-dux.md). He said he's not to be trusted. He had a run in with him in [Waterdeep](locations/waterdeep.md).
	- There was conference.  [Mordenkainen](npcs/mordenkainen.md) and [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) were there. About 5 years ago.
	- He thinks [Double Dux](npcs/double-dux.md) was responsible for teaching [The Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md) about spelljamming.
	- He was double crossed by Double Dux.
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) told [Edgin](npcs/edgin-darvis.md) we looked in the crates. Edgin was glad that we were honest.
- We mentioned to Edgin that we purchased items from [Borgol Kirdis](npcs/borgol-kirdis.md) He told us to be careful of curses.
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) cast detect magic and spotted a scrying eye. He cast dispel on it and Edgin freaked out. We showed him [The Red Wizard's Blade](other/the-red-wizards-blade.md). He told us there were only 13 of them, 8 of which were accounted for.
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) asked [Edgin](npcs/edgin-darvis.md) about [Myla](npcs/myla.md). He said he'd in contact if he saw her.
- He asked us to tell [Double Dux](npcs/double-dux.md) "I want my money back."
- We left [Two Stars](locations/two-stars.md) and got about 6 hours out of town before setting up camp.
	- We rested without interruption.
	- An owl kept hooting.
- We continued on to [Mulsantir](locations/mulsantir.md). [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) suggested we all hop in the cart.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) mentioned having dreams again, but said they were to personal to share. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) told him dreams can be fun and sometimes important, but he said this dream was not fun.
	- Kulgan drove most of the way, but swapped with Rudy later on so he could cast Mending on the cart a bit.
- Along the road we encountered another cart with some red robed people inside. They stopped and didn't respond to our calls
	- One of them seemed to be a Pale Elf.
	- The leader's  name was [M'weru](npcs/mweru.md)
		- They demanded the blade saying it was theirs.
		- They claimed to be the Zulkir of evocation
	- The fight started
		- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) counterspelled the Zulkir and in turn they instructed everyone to target him.
		- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) was knocked unconcious in the fight. The Zulkir grabbed the blade, but Raven managed to grab it back from her.
