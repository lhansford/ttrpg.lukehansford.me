# Session 52 (2024-11-24)

- We continued fighting the [Neogi](neogi.md). We managed to defeat the last one quickly.
- All the doors were locked. Raven got one open and there was a chest in a small room. The other room contained the same.
- We went downstairs. Raven opened the first door and there were four [Neogi](neogi.md) inside.
	- The fight went sideways quickly. Raven opened the Eversmoking Bottle and everyone was just swinging around wildly. We managed to win in the end.
- We explored the ship but found no adult Neogi. We did find lots of Neogi eggs though. We ended up destroying them.
- We contacted Rupphisk and Tregchumel. They came out of hiding. We talked about the dragon situation.
- They rewarded us with some magical items.
- The Mindflayers asked us some questions
	- They asked [Raven](raven.md) where she was from, she say the feywild. They asked which one/which part, which should couldn't answer.
	- They mentioned the Nautiloid could planeshift.
	- They asked if they could join our fleet and travel with us.
		- They were already on the way to Orkani. Zalani is on the way.
- With 3 ships now we've decided to call it the Freedom Flotilla, with Raven as admiral.
