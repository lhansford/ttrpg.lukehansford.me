# Session 70 (2025-04-13)

- We continued fighting the Astral Anglerfish.
	- We managed to defeat them without trouble.
- [Raven](raven.md) investigated one of the broken bits of ship and we found some wine barrels with Githyanki writing on them. [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) tried to cut some steaks off the fish.
- [Raven](raven.md) tried to understand who the god might have been, but had no luck. [Swan](swan.md) kept an eye out as we moved forward.
- [Swan](swan.md) spotted a giant tentacle creature hiding near the cave entrance.
	- We snuck up to see what was going on.
		- [Raven](raven.md) found a githyanki crushed under a large ballista. It was wearing very nice looking armor.
- We went down the cave further and encountered a room full of black puddings.
	- During the fight [Raven](raven.md) got a glimpse of a terrifying creature in the adjoining cave.
	- We defeated the puddings, but decided to avoid the room with the "* of Annihilation".
- The room to the left was a sphincter like passageway that was closing up and then opening again. [Raven](raven.md) went ahead first, with the group following on. Some of them got a little bit squished by the passageway.
- We entered another room, and as we passed though were attacked by 4 sinewy creatures.
