# Session 45 (2024-09-29)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) met up and discussed what they'd seen with Kez and El'a.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went fishing with a guy. 
	- He mentioned the dragon having shut down the mining operations.
- Raven and Swan ran into [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) and he asked them to got to market with him. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and El'a simultaneously decided to go to the market to get something to eat.
- *I had to step out and missed a bit.*
- We got to chatting with the two illithids in the marketplace. They asked us to help out with the moon dragon and confirmed it wasn't very nice (killed 40 people).
	- They offered us a ton of cool items to bring them the dragon's brain.
	- Apparently Uma Minewarden
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) and [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) went for a walk. Coleslaw suggested Kez smile more often, and that maybe either Raven or Swan has a crush on him.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) hinted that it might be Swan.
- We spoke with Master Warburton Weatherby. He asked us to help with the dragon
- We headed to the mine.
	- Raven asked who could speak Draconic. [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) said he could. Raven said she'd try to ask the dragon to leave.
		- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked how she knew draconic and Raven mentioned she learnt it because her old master used to hunt dragons for spell components.
