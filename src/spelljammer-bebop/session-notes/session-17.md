# Session 17 (2024-02-25)

- [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) was on his date with [Captain Del](npcs/captain-del.md). [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked [Raven](pcs/raven.md) if she wanted to go spy on them. We followed them to Large Luigi's, but didn't do a good job of hiding. Del invited us to go have a drink with them.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) asked [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) why he's so different. And then Swan asked him if he wanted a makeover. While doing so, Swan asked why [Myla](npcs/myla.md) is so important and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) got very serious.
	- Rudy mentioned being tasked as the protector of Myla.
	- He mentioned being form the city of Metrol.
- [Del](npcs/captain-del.md) took us to a bar called The Edge. On the way [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) spotted some pickpockets.
- At the bar there was a duel going on (for sport). [Raven](pcs/raven.md) snuck up and threw ball bearings on the fighting pit and both the fighters collapsed. A bar brawl started.
- We decided to return to [The Second Wind](locations/the-second-wind.md). As we left [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) noticed [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) on the second level of the bar.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) told [Del](npcs/captain-del.md) he thinks she might have a drinking problem. It didn't go down well.
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) was disguised as a clown when they returned. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) got surprised and threw a knife at him.
- We had some drinks on [The Second Wind](locations/the-second-wind.md). [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) tried one but didn't taste anything and asked us to describe it.
- Kez went and invited Ravarel to join for a drink. Kulgan gave a toast. Swan thought that Kez and Raven were dating. Raven tried to bungee off the ship but just feel straight down.
- Kulgan managed to get a kiss from Del.
- We went to bed.
- The next morning someone requested to board the ship. They were a courier looking for Kez. A royal guard of the Astral Elves. They had an invite to a garden party.
- Everyone except Raven got dressed up nicely.
	- Swan had a beautiful dress and did herself up to make herself look more elf like, and with an accent.
- Kez looked anxious as we headed to the party. He told Raven that he was on good terms with the [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md), but that he can be quite irritating and just to ignore what he says (no killing).
- At Starhaven we were given an escort, a halfling named Felix. He led us to the garden where the party was about to start.
- At the party we met [[prince-xeleth]] and Prince Andy.
	- Other guests
		- Gadaric main (counsel of Prince Andy)
		- Kulena (counsel of Prince Xeleth)
- Everyone sat at the tables.
- The Prince told us the following.
	- The star in Xaryyxis space is dying
	- They think they can bring the citadel to orbit the sun in Realmspace (with the help of the Red Wizards).
	- Prince Andy doesn't want this to happen.
	- There's a spy. Somebody feeding Prince Andy info on what the Elves plans are.
		- The spy, a woman about [[prince-xeleth]]'s age. She was sent to scout out realmspace, but never returned. Their location is a moving target (a ship). She's shacked up with Grimzin Gargenhale, a pirate known for attacking the Astral Elf fleet. Vampirates.
		- [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md) wants us to take out the spy.
		- He wouldn't tell us the spy's name.
		- Last seen in Realmspace, drifting about.
- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) said he "will personal handle this traitor".
- We agreed to a price of 1000gp each + a magical sword.
	- [Swan](swan.md) also asked if she could learn how to use her psychic abilities better.
- The Prince recommended we check for info with Grimzin's ex-girlfriend. Her name is Topela and maintains an observatory near Glith (should register on a Wildspace Orrery).
- Prince Andy returned. Gadaric nodded at one of the guards and he drew his blade on [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md).
