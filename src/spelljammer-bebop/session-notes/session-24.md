# Session 24 (2024-04-14)

- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) complained about having weird dreams, almost like visions of fighting orcs and dark elves underground.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) said they might be recollections of a past life and that she's on her third.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) went to buy manacles and a flask for [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md).
	- She gave to the manacles to [Swan](pcs/swan.md). She asked if it was a gift.
- Duncan mentioned there's music and dance at the main castle every night.
	- He tried to pin us down a little bit on being from the New Coast
	- He seemed a bit suspicious of us, but [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said not to "look a gift horse in the mouth."
	- He menionted the knights of tarquissis.
	- He said if we meet a guy by the name of Lars, say "Duncan sends his best".
- We went and met with [Wyhan](npcs/wyhan.md).
	- She had so many questions about the ring and its origins.
	- We decided to tell her about our origin, [Raven](pcs/raven.md) told her to go visit the Book Prison.
		- Told her to keep it hush hush though.
	- Tarquissis
		- Goddess of control and evil.
		- The dragon queen.
		- She came along time as a refugee from space/time
- We left [Kalaman](locations/kalaman.md) and headed towards the last known location of Vera.
	- [sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) did some druidcraft to tell us that it would rain later in the day.
	- Along the way we saw a short person herding some sheep
		- They were a red-headed Kender woman named Marger.
			- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) took issue with her sheep, called them cowards.
			- She mentioned that some of her sheep had gone missing, and that she'd seen beedy eyes in the forest.
			- Marger maybe pickpocketed 9gp and put a wooden spoon in Raven's backpack.
	- We entered the forest.
	- Along the way we found a dead Kalaman soldier. [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) investigated the body and it doesn't seem like Vera.
		- The body didn't seem to have any possessions on it.
- We snuck up on the camp
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) snuck up on the camp.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) spotted some creatures in the trees.
	- There was a downed soldier and [Vera Woodstone](npcs/vera-woodstone.md) tied up to a tree.
	- Swan and Raven snuck up to Vera, but one of the draconians noticed us just as we got to her.
