# Session 32 (2024-06-16)

- We arrived near [New Evermeet](new-evermeet.md).
	- As we flew in the group, sans [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md), chatted in the crew quarters.
	- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) went to his bed to study. As he did he noticed a bunch of creatures coming up the stairs. Weird little floating gem tentacle guys. They attacked [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) when he entered the room and one clamped on to his face.
		- We fought some of them off, but more kept coming up from the hold.
		- After we killed a few more [Raven](raven.md) ran downstairs and found a few more, plus a really disgusting egg nest of the creatures.
		- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went down in the combat, but [Raven](raven.md) managed to get a potion to him just in time.
		- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) tried to banish the egg cluster but it seemed to shake off the spell (legendary resist?).
		- We eventually managed to defeat the creatures.
	- [Raven](raven.md) studied the creatures a bit. They are a type of creature that results from corruption near far realm portals. After 30 days they can turn into nests and produce more.
		- We suspect they got on board in Krynn. [Raven](raven.md) asked [Wyhan](wyhan.md) if they're from Krynn, but she hadn't seen them. [The Cowboy](the-cowboy.md) had also never seen one, but said weird shit gets on the ship sometime.
			- [Raven](raven.md) has suspicions that maybe the creatures were placed on [The Second Wind](the-second-wind.md) intentionally by someone
	- We spoke a bit about the look of [New Evermeet](new-evermeet.md) as we approached.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) asked about some new feelings he was feeling. [Raven](raven.md) asked if he wanted to go for a walk and talk about it (to be continued next week!).
