# Session 37 (2024-07-28)

- We had breakfast before heading to Vocath's Blood Sport Arena LeagUe Championships.
	- [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) accompanied us to "wine and dine" the leaders.
- We went up the Infinite Staircase
	- We met a little bird-orb-eye guy thing who was acting as the doorman.
		- Their name was Goonballoon
	- They took as through a portal to the Blood Sport Arena.
	- We made fun of Kez a bit for reacting a bit weird to Goonballoon. The Princess went and spoke to him to calm him down.
		- She mentioned that maybe Swan or Raven like him. He said Swan is likely to stab him and that Raven is just a good friend.
- We went to meet Vocath.
- We entered the fight
	- We encountered a dragon who wanted to fight. He told Raven he might have a cool gun.
