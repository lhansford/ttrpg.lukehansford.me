# Session 67 (2025-03-23)

- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) messaged [El'a](npcs/ela.md) on [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md)'s behest, telling the fleet to meet us at [New Evermeet](locations/new-evermeet.md).
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked [Myla](npcs/myla.md) about how [Sigil](locations/sigil.md) works and she talked a bit about the Lady of Pain.
	- She mentioned a gatehouse in the hive district where there was a door to [Pandemonium](locations/pandemonium.md).
	- The Black Sail Tavern, in the third stall of the bathroom, has a doorway to the River Styx.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked if she knew of a door to a place called [Oerth](locations/oerth.md). She said we could ask around.
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) asked [Myla d'Lyrandar](npcs/myla.md) of [Alustriel Silverhand](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md).
	- She mentioned that she's a powerful wizard. Probably more powerful than [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md). Very knowledgeable, very old. High mage of a place called Silverymoon on [Toril](locations/toril.md)
	- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) recalled her as being one of the most well liked leaders in [Toril](locations/toril.md). She was also known as "Lady Hope", and was one of the most powerful magic users around. She left Silverymoon a long time ago.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) asked what we should do in regards to [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md). She tried to clock what [Myla](npcs/myla.md)'s reaction was. She seemed to react with some internal thought and confusion.
- We left to see [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md). [Myla](npcs/myla.md) and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) raced ahead. She asked [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) not to yell at [Raven](pcs/raven.md).
- We entered the building [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) asked us to visit. There we saw [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md), [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md), and [Elminster](npcs/elminster.md).
	- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) started talking to us about the situation with [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) and how we we're the only one's who could help.
	- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) joined the meeting late. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) started to freak out a bit. She went around and asked who we all were. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) left the room before she could get to her.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) mentioned he was actually from [Toril](locations/toril.md) (though he didn't really know that).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) left to check on [Swan](pcs/swan.md).
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) spoke with [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and managed to calm her down about [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md). She told [Swan](pcs/swan.md) she'd protect her.
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) and [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) spoke with [Elminster](npcs/elminster.md). Elminster asked if he had any of his books and spells. Ravarel didn't have any, so he gave him a spell scroll of Illusory Script.
- [Elminster](npcs/elminster.md) went to speak to [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) and [Myla](npcs/myla.md) about [Eberron](locations/eberron.md). [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) mentioned how she'd created a portal that could get to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md).
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) traded the pirate smut book for a cookbook with [Elminster](npcs/elminster.md).
- [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md) mentioned "a Vecna problem" being disposed of, but now another great evil had arised.
	- She mentioned that her main residence was connected to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md), [Oerth](locations/oerth.md), and [Toril](locations/toril.md).
	- She mentioned that the King of the Elven Armada had perished.
	- They mentioned that there's great power available to [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md), that while far away is easy to resist, up close its much harder.
	- There's two rings that the prince and princess wear, as well as an amulet. They've been handed down over centuries of astral elvenkind. 
	- They believe the best way to stop [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) is to suck the light from Xarxyis in a slower way than Xeleth intends to.
	- The amulet was "swallowed by a god, then swallowed by a beast" who floats in astral space. It's prophesised that the "one who is marked by storms" should attune to the amulet and fly into Xaryxis to destroy it.
	- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) seemed to disagree. [Omnis](npcs/omnis.md) agreed with [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) and said there's another way.
		- He said we can't punish people for sins that haven't happened yet.
	- They mentioned that [Kas the Betrayer](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md) was in alliance with [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) and [The Red Wizards](other/the-red-wizards.md).
	- [Szass Tamm](npcs/szass-tamm.md), [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md), and [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) need to gather to make the final push. The group were tracking [Szass Tamm](npcs/szass-tamm.md), but [Kas](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md) apparently could be tracked.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) got a clear feeling that there was a doppelg√§nger in the room with us. She messaged us and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) asked if we could take few hours to think about things.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) realised that [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) had no smell when they shook hands at leaving.
	- Swan got some information from her Ring of Names. The ring said "Tasha", but there's some complication to that that we don't know about yet.
