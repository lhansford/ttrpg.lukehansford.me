# Session 44 (2024-09-22)

- We managed to defeat the ship-shark, but only after the Frenzy took quite a lot of damage.
	- We found a big ass sword called the Hullbreaker on it. [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) took it.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) snuck up on [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and saw he was reading "Captaining for Dummies 101". Raven suggested that Swan don't make fun of him for it.
- We got to [Port Drogheda](locations/port-drogheda.md).
	- As we arrived we spotted some Star Moths flying off. Most likely from the armada.
- We landed and met a greeter who asked us what business we had. We were honest about our aims.
- We headed towards the Hippo's Snout to look for Master Warburton.
	- On the way Raven scouted for underworld activity. She spotted some thieves cant pointing to a backalley dice game.
	- We went in and ordered some drinks.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked the bartender about the armada but got no info.
		- He also spoke to someone named Stacy Powderkeg. She kind of made fun of him, but pointed him in the direction of someone who had got in a fight with some elves.
	- Raven and Swan went to the dice game.
		- We met with the folk and started playing.
		- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) spoke with a cute elf named El'a. She had spent some time in Bral, and mentioned she left because of the Astral Elves. She hadn't seen any in [Port Drogheda](locations/port-drogheda.md) though and seemed surprised at the mention of Star Moths (seemed honest about it too).
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) had a chat with Flapjack the Flumph.
		- Flapjack mentioned having been to [Eberron](locations/eberron.md).
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) started a drinking game with Rudy, Winchester the Red, and ZigZag.
		- ZigZag lost but said she wasn't actually taking part and bailed.
		- No one wanted to start a fight so everyone came to a compromise.
		- [Coleslaw](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) asked who wanted to go fishing and a gnome named Rump Whipplepick said yes. They went fishing.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) went and spoke to the Giff that had got into a fight. Turns out it was El'a that had got into a fight with them because she'd cheated.
		- Kez and Ravarel almost got into a fight with the Giff as well.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) approached the dice game. Raven yelled "it's the fuzz"!
		- Most of the people ran but El'a, Pumpershmidtz, and Raven stayed put.
		- Kez started threatening El'a but Raven made it clear they'd already had the conversation.
		- El'a started hitting on Kez. She mentioned a Moon Dragon had nested in this moon.
		- Raven asked Pumpershmidtz if he had any idea. He teleported away and came back with information that three star moths were waiting out of the planet.
		- Raven, annoyed that she was hitting on Kez, told Pumpershmitz that El'a had been cheating and stormed off.
		- Swan snuck back to see what was going on. She heard Kez and El'a flirting, said "What the fuck" in Kez's head, and stormed off.
