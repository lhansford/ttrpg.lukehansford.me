# Session 26 (2024-04-28)

- We opted to take [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md) back to [Kalaman](kalaman.md) and not go further towards the watchtower.
- We decided to sleep on the ship for the night. We introduced [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md) to [Spruce](spruce.md). She was very excited.
- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) went and spoke to [The Cowboy](the-cowboy.md) and [Captain Del](captain-del.md) about bringing people onboard. They seemed cool with it.
- [Raven](raven.md), [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md), and [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) spoke to [Wyhan](wyhan.md). Her mind was a little bit blown by the books. [Raven](raven.md) offered for her to join us on [The Second Wind](the-second-wind.md) and she was more than eager.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) requested that she find a way to get to [Eberron](eberron.md). She said that's its possible by going via [Sigil](sigil.md).
	- [Wyhan](wyhan.md) was super pissed at [The Red Wizards](the-red-wizards.md).
	- She mentioned she's a black cloak, which are sometimes considered not nice wizards.
- We decided, after much arguing, to go back to the watchtower and stop what was happening there.
	- We took [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md) to Lord Bakaris. He was happy to see her. 
	- We decided to go clear out the watchtower. Bakaris gave us 400gp each and horses.
	- Vera wanted to come, but Bakaris wouldn't let her and Swan persuaded her to stay.
	- [Vera Woodstone](vera-woodstone.md) asked [Swan](swan.md) to tell Heshod's favour that he was dead.
		- She forged a letter from the government.
- We went to [The Red Wizards](the-red-wizards.md) enclave in [Kalaman](kalaman.md).
	- [Swan](swan.md) met the wife of Dovghest. She mentioned he was on an errand.
	- She tried to sell some things to [Swan](swan.md). Swan mentioned Raven's ring and she realised it came from Thayan wizards.
	- She mentioned that Dovghest was also at the watchtower.
- Horses
	- Kez: Charlie
	- Raven: Shadow
	- Ravarel: Pip
	- Rudy: Chuck
- We left for the watchtower.
	- As we approached [Raven](raven.md) could see an argument happening at the front gate.
		- One party was a man covered in tattoos with a club, and a man with straight white hair dressed like the woman at the Enclave.
			- Most likely Dovghest Arguhl.
			- The wizard was arguing about an item in the watchhouse of his.
		- The other party was draconian army members.
