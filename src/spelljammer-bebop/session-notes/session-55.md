# Session 55 (2024-12-15)

- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) decided to sneak ahead and see what was down the river, but was immediately spotted by some gargoyles and "spore chonks".
- The rest of the group swam up to join the fight.
	- A cloud of spores erupted from the wall and attacked us.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went down in the middle of the river, but [Raven](raven.md) managed to revive him.
	- We managed to defeat the creatures.
- [Raven](raven.md) looked around for Wingnut, but saw no sign. She did see a door which she immediately opened. Behind the door were three gargoyles, including Commander [Nozuun](nozuun.md).
	- One of the gargoyles closed the door. We readied up, but [Nozuun](nozuun.md) snuck through a backdoor and started attacking [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md).
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) summoned the troutlord.
	-
