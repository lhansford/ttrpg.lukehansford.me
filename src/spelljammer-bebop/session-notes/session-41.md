# Session 41 (2024-08-25)

- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) got dibs on the big room.
	- Later on [Swan](pcs/swan.md) asked if she could bunk up.
- The team went shopping.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) had a side conversation.
		- Swan gave Raven a necklace, Raven gave Swan the Slippers of Spider Climbing.
		- They also talked a bit about her having to show her true self.
		- Swan thanked Raven for supporting her.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) also talked to [Swan](pcs/swan.md) in support of her showing her true self.
- The queen mentioned she got in touch with an Admiral Warwyck.
	- Leader of "The Eternal Shields"
	- They have 6 bombard spelljammers.
	- He's on a moon of En in Doomspace called "Aarun", being "hunted by trees". Home of the trusks.
- We headed off on the SJ Frenzy's maiden voyage.
- A few days later [Swan](pcs/swan.md) organised a "surprise party" for [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md).
	- Turned out it was an intervention.
	- We talked about it a bit. Swan said not to make deals with "devils, demons, or fey".
	- At some point there was a knock at the door, it was Raphael.
	- He updated us on his side of things and gave us some information.
	- He said that he would happily exchange Ravarel's soul if we give him five other souls.
	- To everyone's dismay Ravarel agreed.
	- We discussed it further, [Raven](pcs/raven.md) suggested a heist instead to get back Ravarel's soul coin.
- Xedalli told us a story about how her father was attacked by someone called "the Stranger". He failed in his assassination, and was captured. For years the elves questioned him, but could not get him to say who sent him. The elves figured out that he was hired by someone very powerful, and he knows their true names. He's cursed with hundreds of powerful entities true names, which he refuses to give up.
- We got to the moon. [Xedalli](npcs/princess-xedalli.md) said we shouldn't go below 300ft to avoid the tarrasques (not "trusks"!). We spotted [Admiral Warwick](npcs/admiral-warwick.md), but also a few of the starfish creatures. We went down to pick him up, but the creatures jumped us.
