# Session 28 (2024-05-19)

- We started out in the middle of the fight at the outpost.
	- The death dragon and the knight remained.
	- During the fight the dragon was reviving creatures with its breath weapon.
	- We managed to kill all the other draconians, but the dragon kept dodging us and doing its breath attack.
- We spoke with [Dovghest Arguhl](dovghest-arghul.md)
	- We managed to trick him about the wand's location. He thinks its in the abyss after the ritual casters were pushed into the vortex.
	- He mentioned an associate "Darlon" who would have his ass for losing the wand.
	- He also mentioned a Lord Soth who leads the dragon armies at the will of Tiamat, aka the Dragon Queen.
	- [Dovghest Arguhl](dovghest-arghul.md) mentioned there's a portal to [Eberron](eberron.md) in [Sigil](sigil.md).
	- Darlon Mar, zulkir of enchantment. Stood in the way of [Szass Tamm](szass-tamm.md) taking charge in Thay, but they lost.
	- The Thayan exiles call themselves "The Separatists" or "The Separatist Merchants".
	- She mentioned [M'weru](mweru.md) was exiled, but still loyal to Tam. She was exiled for letting [Double Dux](double-dux.md) get too close to the inner circle.
	- Dovghest asked us to help him search for his wand.
