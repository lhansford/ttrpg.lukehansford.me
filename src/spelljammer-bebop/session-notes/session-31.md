# Session 31 (2024-06-09)

- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) shared with us that there's a 10000GP bounty on our heads. But for Kulgan, not Slathasss.
- We suspect that it was made by [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md).
- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) wasn't too happy about the situation.
- [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) told us that he was considering retirement.
	- He wants to find a station floating about the astral and retire there.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) shared that she's a changeling.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) threatened that everyone should keep the secret.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) mentioned she wants to go home, via [Sigil](locations/sigil.md). But she's scared of [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md).
- We told [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) about the red hand letter we received. He asked if it has an eyeball on it. We looked and it did. He left without saying a word.
- We decided to stop first at [Topolah](npcs/topolah.md)'s Lighthouse.
	- Along the way [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) went to ask [The Cowboy](npcs/the-cowboy.md) something. He asked him if he could ask around for Myla in Bral.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) asked him about the red hand.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) came and chatted with [Raven](pcs/raven.md). He seemed to be fishing to see if she thought he'd make a good Captain.
- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) tried to send a message to [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md). He told him that we had a lead on the Princess and were working on it.
	- He replied back, but to [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md). He asked us to meet him at [The Citadel](locations/the-citadel.md).
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) convinced us to go, though we were a bit reluctant.
- As we travelled through [The Astral Sea](locations/the-astral-sea.md) a giant sphere approached us. As it got closer it said "Hello" and transformed into an image of a giant woman".
	- She mentioned she was originally from Oerth, from Castle Greyhawk.
	- She was a friend of Tenser, her name was Otiluke. She died at the hands of someone named Rary.
	- He said that he could give us aid, and in doing so it would also help him.
		- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) asked if [Myla](npcs/myla.md) was safe.
			- He said "she's older than that", in response to the image Rudy showed. He said she's safe.
			- He said that she can be reached via [Sigil](locations/sigil.md), and that there's a portal nearby.
			- He gave a warning - "I don't think she wants to be found".
			- "Many people died that day, the last train out of Metrol. Her uncle survived." She was found in New Evermeet, a safe haven for elves and others who don't wish to live under the thumb of the Armada. She was found and convinced Rudy abandoned her, and that she never wants to see Rudy again.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) asked about the location of the Princess.
		- She's in the quarters of a Lady Soshara ..., in an estate outside the shipyards of [New Evermeet](locations/new-evermeet.md). The vampirate had dumped her and her heart was broken.
		- To get to [New Evermeet](locations/new-evermeet.md) - "Think of a island in blue, think of Lady Soshara ..., think of the High Admiral ..., Be careful not to share its existence."
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) went to speak with [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md).
	- He talked about how he can feel things now, and even bleeds.
	- He was angry, saying that he had abandoned [Myla](npcs/myla.md). [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) tried to calm him down, which the eventually did. We said that we should try and seek her out, but maybe gather some more background info first.
	- At the end of the conversation he ate one of [Raven](pcs/raven.md)'s cookie and could taste it.
