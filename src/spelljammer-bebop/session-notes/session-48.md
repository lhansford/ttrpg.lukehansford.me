# Session 48 (2024-10-27)

- We continued combat with LhamValosFelAtar
	- We got a couple of more hits in.
	- On its turn, the dragon grabbed the unconscious Swan and flew through the portal.
		- Unknownst to us, the dragon revived her and they parlayed on the other side. They came to an agreement where the dragon could return and retrieve the egg, and Swan told the dragon of a safe haven in the Feywild.
	- Raven sprinted into the portal and came upon Swan and the dragon parlaying. Swan convinced Raven to go along.
	- The three returned together and tried to convince the others to go along. They did so very begrudgingly.
		- After the dragon left Rudy angrily confronted Swan, but it was left unresolved.
- We returned to town, but on the way [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) spotted one of the Armada Star Moth's over the town. We stopped for short rest, and then approached the town.
- We argued a bit about what to do but ended up just going through the front door.
	- [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md) was there. Swan faked being the princess and they and Kez went to a backroom to converse.
		- During the conversation [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md) mentioned he wanted to ascend to godhood and that he and Xedalli are "the chosen ones".
	- The rest of the group snuck to the other room where the real princess was.
		- We spoke to the princess and organised an escapse. She took an invisibility potion and left the room with us. Rudy stayed upstairs, Ravarel downstairs, and Raven accompanied her towards the ship.
