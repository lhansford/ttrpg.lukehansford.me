# Session 59 (2025-01-12)

- We continued discussing the heist.
- [Raven](raven.md) asked more about the scrub room.
	- It wasn't clear if it would catch our magic items. [Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md) suggested that we use the portable hole.
- [Swan](swan.md) asked if anyone had tried to break out before
	- A demon named "Eru" escaped. They believe they had help from something more powerful in the abyss.
- There was some discussion about maybe trying to trick [Dubbuldux](dubbuldux.md) or converse with the Red Wizards.
- [Swan](swan.md) suggest we pretend to be there to inspect the prison. We have four uniforms we could use.
	- Rudy would be painted in armada colours.
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) could wildshape.
- We all went off and did bastion stuff
	- [Swan](swan.md) did a theater thing
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) make 2 revivify scrolls and did some fishing.
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) did ???
	- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) studied the detention center and the Vaskir.
		- Any secret entrances/exits?
			- Not so secret, but there is a teleportation circle at the facility.
		- Is there a particular time when guards are less active?
			- No sleep required, so not really.
			- Also strong golems on guards.
		- What kind of wards, and locations?
			- Glyphs of warding, with some tricky ones heading up to the containment room.
			- One to watch out for is one that will cast Suggestion without you knowing it.
			- Nystal's Magic Aura is likely in play, so Detect Magic won't work.
		- What's the Vaskir's relationship with [M'weru](mweru.md)?
			- They know each other.
		- What school of magic?
			- Conjuration, specifically demon-binding.
		- What's the highest level spell they an cast?
			- 8th
	- [Raven](raven.md) made some alchemists fire and studied about the comms methods of the prison.
		- How does the prison communicate with the rest of the Armada?
			- There is a sending station in the super's office that communicates with [The Citadel](the-citadel.md) and some shops.
			- Also likely some wizards have capabilities.
			- There's a device in the warden office capable of casting skywriting.
				- We also have skywriting on [Mothy](mothy.md).
		- Are there spelljammers at or nearby the prison?
			- Typically no.
		- Arcanaloth resistances?
			- Typically little fox-like creatures. Fiends! They know abyssal usually.
			- Probably doesn't care much about poison or acid.
			- Good magic users. Innate spell-casting, can't necessarily counter-spell.
			- Up to 7/8 level spells typically.
- We all had parts
	- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) would be Record Unit D3
	- [Raven](raven.md) would be Kylana
	- [Swan](swan.md) would be "High Admiral"
	- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) would be Edgin
	- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) would be Bacharus Snippington.
	- We would split into two groups.
		- One group to the prisoner containment unit to get the Stranger and Prince Andy.
			- Rudy, Kez, Swan.
		- The second group would go to the security station and cause a distraction.
			- Ravarel, Slathass, Raven.
- [Raven](raven.md) cast Commune (this was kept to herself though).
	- Will the Stranger come willingly?
		- Yes
	- Can the Stranger be trusted?
		- Unclear
	- Are there any other prisoners that I should free?
		- No
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) used his fish hook to get a fish that in a meal that increases our max HP by 5 and adv. for saving throws against Fear.
- On the trip [Swan](swan.md) came to speak to [Raven](raven.md) privately.
	- [Swan](swan.md) said she'd been thinking a lot about the Feywild since [Port Drogheda](port-drogheda.md).
	- During the conversation Swin separated from [Swan](swan.md) and started talking independently, saying they need to return to the Feywild.
	- [Swan](swan.md) told [Raven](raven.md) how she'd previously not been a changeling, and had been going from plane to plane. She'd gotten into trouble with Baba Yaga and was forced to become a hag in service of [Tasha](tasha.md). She spied on Tasha and discovered her name, but was caught and punished by being transformed into a changeling and banished from the Feywild.
	- Swin ended the conversation saying "we must go to [Sigil](sigil.md)".
- [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) and [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) spoke.
	- Rudy gifted him a Sentinel Shield so he wouldn't die so easily.
	- Rudy has inscribed in it "It's a good day to be alive".
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) gave Raven and Ravarel revivify scrolls.
- [Raven](raven.md) spoke to the whole group and [Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md)
	- She apologised for running off in the caves at [Lycanvine](lycanvine.md).
	- She told them that she had previously been a fey spirit, and at some point had been summoned by a wizard to be a familiar. The wizard was evil and treated her poorly, which was why she had such reactions to seeing familiars.
	- Speaking about it [[Raven]] recalled the face of the wizard for the first time. Weird lime green skin, a parting hairline, a terrible little soul patch. Fancy red and pink cloak, likely a gnomish person. [Raven](raven.md) in the moment realised that it was [Dubbuldux](dubbuldux.md).
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) was asked by [Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md) if the Trout Lord was benevolent. He said yes.
	- Sounded like Raven to a Kua-ta cultural practice, where if they don't have a god they make one up, literally.
	- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) recognised it as maybe a god from Chandros, a tribe of Kua-ta.
- We tried to rehearse the play but it bombed and we didn't get the rewards.
- As we approached the station they cast skywrite and sent the message in elvish "State your business and the code".
