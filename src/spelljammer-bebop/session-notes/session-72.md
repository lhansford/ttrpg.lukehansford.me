# Session 72 (2025-04-27)

- We managed to finally kill the hertilod.
	- Inside we found the chimes, as well as a honking horn.
- We decided to take a short rest, which went down without issue.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) took a look at the blob creature as we left and realised it was by far the most powerful thing we would have ever fought.
- We left the internals of the god and encountered a ship of space clowns (summoned by the horn that was squeezed).
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) grabbed the portable hole off of [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and put the dead githyanki in it.
	- Swan and Raven tried to move past the clowns. The clowns started attacking the Aesthetic. They traded words with Kez and Rudy and started to attack us as well.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) went below deck and found a manila folder with the initials LHIC printed on it, as well as boxes of cream pies and a spelljamming helm. She grabbed the folder and helm.
	- We managed to defeat all the space clowns.
- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) is on [Carceri](locations/carceri.md).
