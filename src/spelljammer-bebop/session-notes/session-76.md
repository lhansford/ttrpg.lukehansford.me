# Session 76 (2025-05-25)

- We started out still in the fight. [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) had been carried off by one of the demons.
	- During the fight Raven went down again, but [Swan](swan.md) helped her out.
- We took a short rest nearby.
	- [Swan](swan.md) shared some potions around.
	- [Raven](raven.md) thanked [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) for saving her.
- We headed towards the mountain. As we got closer we could see the outline of a jagged maw on the cliffside. It seemed to have a giant tongue that spilled out and acted as a ramp. We started to climb the tongue, sticking together.
- As we entered we lost our senses temporarily - we realised we were transported into the mountain.
	- We were transported in front of a bunch of demons, including the massive one who left our previous fight, and an ever bigger, fiery fiend.
	- There was also a strange cube, with doors on all sides, like a small snippet of the infinite staircase.
	- The large fiend said "I've been expecting you".
	- We discussed a trade for [Kez](kez-bardaux.md). He would've accepted [Raphael](raphael.md) for [Kez](kez-bardaux.md), but we wanted [Tasha](tasha.md) too.
	- He mentioned that a demon prince, Grazzt, had imprisoned [Tasha](tasha.md) for spurning his love.
		- Demon prince of self-indulgence and decadence. Ruler of 3 layers of the abyss.
	- Nothing seemed to be able to convince him to let go of Tasha.
	- We offered knowledge of [Containment Facility 53](containment-facility-53.md) in exchange for [Kez](kez-bardaux.md).
	- [Tasha](tasha.md) reached out to [Swan](swan.md).
	- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) was returned to us and the demon told us where to go to leave.
	- [Raven](raven.md) turned invisible and the big demon attacked us.
