# Session 40 (2024-08-18)

- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) thanked [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) for backing him up. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) were pissed.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) went on ahead up the stairs and encoutnered and angelic figure named Lillendi. She asked what was going on and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) told her.
	- She asked us all to come together and talk to her.
	- She said she was responsible for keeping peace in the Infinite Staircase.
	- She asked us to come with her to the Court of Tyr.
- We agreed to join her.
	- We entered the Court. Inside were two Planetars. Outside was snowry mountains and frozen lakes.
	- Leading the Court was someone named Zisa, Consort of Tyr.
	- Zisa called the place "The Hall of Justice in Ysgard".
	- A next of kin spectator named "Polo" joined the session.
	- We all gave our testimony
		- [Vera Woodstone](npcs/vera-woodstone.md) was called as a character witness and said some nice things.
		- Kas the Destroyer, was called and told his side of the story. He mentioned paying Anthony to disintegrate us.
		- [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) was forced to admit he'd made a pact with a devil.
		- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) was forced to show her true form. She was very unhappy about it and Zisa was apologetic.
	- Zisa charged us with littering, a fine of 1000gp, but exhonerated us for killing the beholders as they had been bribed by Kas to kill us.
		- She suggested Ravarel try to get out of his pact.
		- She asked [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) about his oath to the crown. She encouraged him to reconsider his oath.
- We returned to [New Evermeet](locations/new-evermeet.md) and told the Second Wind crew what had happened.
	- Cowboy, Spruce, and Del decided to put roots down there after one last run to Bral.
