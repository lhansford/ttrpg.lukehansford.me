# Session 10 (2024-01-07)

- After the fight [the-unknown-guild](other/the-unknown-guild.md) members came to meet [gazpacho](npcs/gazpacho.md). With them they had a warforged named [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md). Rudy was the one that wanted to meet Gazpacho to seek some info. He was looking for his charge, [myla](npcs/myla.md), and heard that Gazpacho might know how to return to [eberron](locations/eberron.md). 
- Gazpacho was friends with [dubbuldux](npcs/dubbuldux.md). He was working on a spell, Dream of the Blue Veil, that could potentially transport a group to Eberron. He gave Gazpacho a [dragonshard](other/dragonshards.md) that could used as a tether to Eberron. He also mentioned a wizard named [tasha](npcs/tasha.md) in Sigil might have info as well.
	- At the mention of Tasha Swan got visibly uncomfortable and walked away.
	- Raven has now added Tasha to her shitlist (alongside Double Dux).
- We decided to do a smuggling job for the Unknown Guild, taking some "cheese" to Toril. 6 boxes going to [edgin-darvis](npcs/edgin-darvis.md) (with a heart pin on his lapel). At the Two Stars Tavern in Two Stars.
	- We looked in the box and found a bunch of wands.
	- There was also a letter from someone named [jaheira](npcs/jaheira.md). The note wasn't too interesting, but Ravarel noticed it had illusionary script on it.
	- The delivery was from Harpers to [harpers](other/harpers.md). Ravarel filled us in on who it was for.
