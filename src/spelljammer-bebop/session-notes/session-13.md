# Session 13 (2024-01-28)

- We explored the house more. Found a spellbook that exploded. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) also found an emerald.
- We went to the blocked room.
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) passed some things to [Raven](pcs/raven.md). (WHAT WAS IT???)
		- A necklace
		- A garment
		- A hollowed out gourd
- We managed to get into the basement. We found a weird portal and an electricity monster. Finally we found the wizards room.
	- Raven found the following books on the wizard's desk
		- [The Infinite Staircase](other/the-infinite-staircase.md)
		- [Manual of the Planes](other/manual-of-the-planes.md)
		- Sigil city of doors
			- Swan really dislike this book. Raven tried to throw it through the portal but Rudy stopped him.
		- Of An Unknown Sphere
	- Raven found a journal.
		- The owner was [Santhi Ozul](npcs/santhi-ozul.md)
	- We found an extremely valuable [The Red Wizard's Blade](other/the-red-wizards-blade.md).
