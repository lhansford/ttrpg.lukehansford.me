# Session 49 (2024-11-03)

- We started off with [Raven](raven.md), [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md), and [Princess Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md) heading to the ship, and the rest of the crew at the tavern confronting [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md).
	- Ravarel stopped near the docks to keep an eye out and Raven and the Princess continued on.
	- Swan (as fake princess) had requested one last breath of fresh air at the window before her execution.
- The prince told [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) to finish the job and execute [Swan](swan.md).
	- As she stood at the window, Swan stared to manifest her echo on the street down below. Kez also subtly cast Find Steed outside.
	- Swan switched places with her echo and Kez misty stepped out the window onto his steed.
	- The guards rushed after them, ignoring [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md). One of the priests cast Command on him and he had to "flee".
	- [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) cast a spell to wall the tavern in stone. About half the guards and the prince were trapped inside. Soon after though one of the outside guards injured Ravarel badly and the spell was lost.
	- During the retreat Swan dived in the water and shapechanged.
	- We all made our way to the ship. [Raven](raven.md) threw her concussion grenade at a bunch of the guards. [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) damaged the dock as he boarded the ship. [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) started launching the ship.
	- During the escape [Raven](raven.md) got a mind message from one of the illithids asking if we'd completed the job. Raven said no, but we had a lead on a bigger brain. They asked if they could hitch a ride on our ship and Raven said yes.
	- Swan changed again, this time into Leif Barkface.
	- El'a tried to climb on board steathily, but Ravarel spotted her and helped her on board.
