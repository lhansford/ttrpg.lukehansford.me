# Session 78 (2025-06-08)

- As the fight ended, we saw a wave of force leave [Swan](pcs/swan.md) as Swin appeared to fly off, but she didn't make a big fuss of it.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) gave the key to [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and she went to release [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md).
	- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) asked how we knew she was here, and we told her about [Alustriel](npcs/alustriel-silverhand.md).
	- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) asked for her horns back. As [Swan](pcs/swan.md) returned them she seemed to transform. Her skin was more grayish and she seemed to have an imprint of horns just barely visible. Her eyes had cracks around them, almost like scales.
	- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) told [Swan](pcs/swan.md) that she'd travelled far. She talked a bit about the power of true names, and how [Swan](pcs/swan.md) didn't really understand it before.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) asked [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) about [The Sovereign](npcs/the-sovereign.md).
- [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) noticed [Vraxil](npcs/vraxil-of-the-twilight.md). He referred to her as the [Queen of the Arcane](npcs/tasha.md) and [Iggwilv](npcs/tasha.md). He said she controlled the power that bounded the creature he was supposed to be guarding.
- We told [Tasha](npcs/tasha.md) about [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md)'s soul situation as well. She asked what he was doing to prepare, and he told her we had [Raphael](npcs/raphael.md)'s true name.
	- She asked what we'd do with it. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) talked about a plan, but she picked it apart. "You need to prepare your heart" is what she said.
	- We also discussed breaking into the vault, but she dismissed that as impossible.
