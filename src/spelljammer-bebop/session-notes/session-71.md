# Session 71 (2025-04-20)

- We continued navigating the dead god and where attacked by some large sinew-y creatures.
	- We managed to defeat them despite their psychic resistances.
- Moving on we came to what we think might've been the heart, but we were attacked by some veiny creatures.
	- Very quickly a huge monstrosity emerged. As it roared we heard the sound of wind chimes.
	- The creature bit at [Raven](pcs/raven.md) and she leaped into its mouth. Eventually it regurgitated her.
