# Session 60 (2025-01-19)

- We received a message from the prison. "Identify yourself and repeat the code".
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) looked around the bridge for the code. She found the device used to activate the Skywrite machine. It seemed to have encoding built-in. We message "Unscheduled inspection on the order of Prince Xeleth."
	- 5305 was the code output in the sky.
	- The prison responded for us to approach the main entrance.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) psychically connected to everyone but [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md).
- We arrived at the docks and disembarked. Waiting for us were two platinum golems and an astral elf warrior.
- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) told them we were here for an inspection. That bought it and went to get the warden.
- At the entrance of the building there was a magical barrier.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) walked through and had something cast on him. He saved, unclear what was cast.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) studied the device and realised there was a button on the wall which [Swan](pcs/swan.md) hit and it turned off the barrier.
- We reached the lobby. A guard inside went to fetch Assistant Warden Parsec.
- Platinum Golems. Large constructs. Immune to psychic and poison damage. But fine with radiant.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md), [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md), and [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went with Parsec to his office outside the prison.
	- He, the warden, and the superintendent all have a device in their coats that can override security features.
- Warden Golmook went to meet the others.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) lied about our starmoth having been scuttled by the Resistance. He maybe bought it.
	- They went to the observation deck. On the way they spotted [Dubbuldux](npcs/dubbuldux.md) with a raven familiar.
	- In the containment facility was mostly devils and demons. [Prince Andy](npcs/prince-andy.md) was there, as well as [The Stranger](npcs/the-stranger.md).
- Team 2 went with Parsec to the observation deck. He mentioned having a device to destroy the cores. The warden and the superintendent do as well.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) might have blown her cover when she mentioned [Prince Xeleth](npcs/prince-xeleth.md) and Parsec got suspicious.
- Team 1 met the Superintendent, and then went with the Warden to the scrub room, and then in to the containment facility.
- Team 2 went back to the assistant warden's office. He was suspicious and entered the containment facility. The team prepped to attack him when he returned.
- The warden demonstrated how the prison works with Parsec as a test subject. [Swan](pcs/swan.md) tried to persuade the warden to keep him there for a bit as a punishment for insubordination.
