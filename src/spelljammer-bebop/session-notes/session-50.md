# Session 50 (2024-11-10)

- We took off with [Wyhan](wyhan.md) at the helm. [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) healed [Ravarel](ravarel-deshent.md) and [Swan](swan.md) and [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) checked on the princess.
- [Raven](raven.md) went over to [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) to ask him what the plan was. He was a bit snippy but decided we should flee. [Raven](raven.md) gave him Guidance.
- [Swan](swan.md) told the Princess about the Portal Hole in case she needs to hide. She also passed the Goodberry Wine to [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) to heal a bit.
	- [Swan](swan.md) tried to convince [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) to hide in the hole as well.
- We tried to escape the other star moths.
	- We encountered one star moth and the other two fled.
		- We decided to board that star moth.
		- During the fight a wizard at the helm attacked Kez and Raven. Raven engaged him. Unknown to her it was [Dubbuldux](dubbuldux.md).
		- He asked us who the hell we were. Raven said we were The Resistance. Raven asked who he was and and he said something along the lines of  "The Great and Might [Dubbuldux](dubbuldux.md)". Raven said she was going to kill him and he Planeshifted.
	- We managed to take control of the ship.
- [Princess Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md) suggested we should visit the nearby planet of Zalani
	- There's a lot of lycanthropes there, as well as gargoyles (native Zelanians?). The two have been in a war.
	- The princess suggested we aid the lycanthropes.
	- We strategised that we could fake an armada attack on the Zelani.
