# Session 35 (2024-07-07)

- We continued to fight the mercenaries, but we weren't fast enough to stop the portal from opening.
	- When the portal opened it sent us to a strange place. The mercenaries were gone but a bunch of elementals surrounded us.
	- The elementals (two fire, two ice) attacked us.
	- We managed to hold them off long enough for the portal to trigger again.
- We arrived back in the tree, but the mercenaries were gone.
- We investigated the bodies and the portal.
	- The high shaman looked dead, but grasping a book of sequences.
	- We managed to figure out that the portal needed those sequences entered to operate it.
