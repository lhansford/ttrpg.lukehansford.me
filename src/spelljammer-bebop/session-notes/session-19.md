# Session 19 (2024-03-10)

-  We started on the [The Second Wind](locations/the-second-wind.md) and headed for Astral Space. The journey was expected to take 60 days or so.
	- We made really good progress and reduced the travel by 10 days.
	- After about 20 days of travel we got impacted by some sort of electrical storm.
		- We did our best to mitigate the situation. [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) caught ?? after he fell from the rigging. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) and [Raven](pcs/raven.md) put out some fires, and [Swan](pcs/swan.md) and [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) helped prevent some sails from getting lost.
		- The ship sustained some damage (15pts of 220pts) during the storm.
	- In the distance we noticed a floating object that was perhaps the observatory [Tupela](npcs/topolah.md). As we approached we could see some manticores attacking the tower.
- We engaged the manticores. At some point [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md) went down. One manticore started to fly off with [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md). He Shocking Grasped it and fell back to the ship. One of the manticore's flew off with [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md).
