# Session 64 (2025-03-02)

- [Akarran](npcs/akarran-sanger.md) transported us to the Concordant Jewel.
- [Speaker Sholeh](npcs/speaker-sholeh.md) was surrounded by vined beings (Astral Blights).
	- There was an Astral Elf demanding that [Speaker Sholeh](npcs/speaker-sholeh.md) give them access to the Jewel. They also had some other people with them, a Plasmoid, a Hadozee, a strange elf, and astral elf guard, and a solar dragon.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) managed to knock out the Commander, but the Asssassin and Dark Dancer ganged up on her to free him.
	- We fought, started getting our assess kicked, but [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) and [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) managed to free [Speaker Sholeh](npcs/speaker-sholeh.md) and drag her away from the vined beings. As she did she transformed into a massive dragon.
