# Session 20 (2024-03-17)

- We discussed what to do about [Kulgan](pcs/kulgan.md)
	- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) said some words, but [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) wanted to go fetch Kulgan's remains.
- [Topolah](npcs/topolah.md) came out of the tower and introduced herself.
	- We spoke with her a bit, told her we were looking for Grimzen and the princess.
	- She told us she didn't know his whereabouts.
	- [Swan](pcs/swan.md) got angry and threatened her, but then stormed off to the ship.
	- [Grimzen Gargenhale](npcs/grimzin-gargenhale.md)'s ship was named The Last Breath.
	- She mentioned spending some time on [Garden](locations/garden.md).
		- A history check told us that [Garden](locations/garden.md) is a junglish planetish place.
	- She can make a potion from blue velvet mushroom. It gives you waterbreathing and a swim speed. She mentioned that it grows on a nearby asteroid and that's where the manticore nest. If we help her clear it she could help us out.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) went so speak to [Swan](pcs/swan.md). She was enraged, stabbing her pillow, half shape-shifted. When she noticed him she transformed back and played it off as if it was all fine.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) informed [Captain Del](npcs/captain-del.md) that Kulgan had been killed. She was devastated.
- [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) also spoke to [Swan](pcs/swan.md), to tell her that he had told [Topolah](npcs/topolah.md) that [Swan](pcs/swan.md)'s name was Brenda.
- We travelled to the asteroid. [Raven](pcs/raven.md) scouted ahead, but got ambushed by some Corpse Flowers. The team came to the rescue, but manticores also attacked. We managed to overcome them.
