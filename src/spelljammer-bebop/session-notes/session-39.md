# Session 39 (2024-08-11)

- Ravarel and Raven started and managed to take down the tower. We were immediately teleported to a room with hottubs. We discussed a bit what spelljammer we would like.
- Vokath came and visited us. He asked our group name and offered some ships.
- In the end we decided on the hammerhead and named it the SJ Frenzy. We also decided our group name would be The Resistance.
- We rested and headed back through the Infinite Staircase. On the way we ran into a beholder named Anthony. He was investigating the pancakes that [Rudy](refuge-unit-d3.md) had thrown - they apparently hit someone named Kas the Destroyer in the face and the punishment was disintegration. Rudy threw some towels off the edge and started a fight.
