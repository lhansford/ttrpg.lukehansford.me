# Session 23 (2024-04-07)

- We began the session mid-battle in [Kalaman](locations/kalaman.md).
	- We won the battle and captured two enemies.
- After the battle we spoke with one of the Kalaman soldiers, Duncan.
	- We told him we were from the New Coast.
	- He asked about Rudy, Raven said he was a magic experiment by [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) gone wrong.
	- We mentioned we were looking for [Neely the Hexsnape](npcs/neely-the-hex-snape.md). He said he didn't know that name, but maybe talk to Lord Bakaris Uth Estide.
	- He recommended the Wanderer's Rest as a place to stay.
	- He took us to the castle
- We had a chat outside the castle
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) mentioned to the group to remember that we have to act like we're from [Krynn](locations/krynn.md).
	- We discussed the odd reaction to [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) from the guard - maybe there's an issue with magic users here?
- We spoke to Lord Bakaris
	- He mentioned tough times across the continent. He said [Kalaman](locations/kalaman.md) has generally been safe from incursions.
	- He said that they're under the shadow of the dragon queen.
	- He mentioned that dragons aren't even supposed to be around any more, since the "cataclysm".
	- We mentioned we were looking for [Neely the Hexsnape](npcs/neely-the-hex-snape.md). He told us that he knew of her already - she was in the dungeon for selling intel to the Dragon Army.
	- He mentioned the possibility for a trade.
		- Some of their scouts went missing. One of them is Lord Barakis' former ward, Vera. Her and Enrico were doing a recon mission about 10 days ago, 20 miles south.
			- Kalaman's souther most outpost, the "Wheelwatch Outpost" had fallen to the Dragon Army. Vera had been sent to scope it and see what their numbers are, if they have dragonelles, etc.
	- The Lord grilled [sssslattthhhhaaassss](pcs/sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) a bit about if he was draconian or not.
	- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) tried to ask for more compensation to rescue Vera. [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) got angry, said he was going to rescue the girl, and left. Lord Barakis said he understood and said he'd cover us.
	- He mentioned we can visit "Wyhan" to get discounted potions etc.
- [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md) and [Rudy](pcs/refuge-unit-d3.md) patched things up.
- We visited Whyan's Apothecary.
	- She was very stand-offish.
	- She traded spells with [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md).
	- We mentioned Lord Bakaris sent us and she became a bit friendlier.
	- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) lent her the Shadow Band to study.
	- She also mentioned having some studded leather with resistance to thunder damage.
