# Session 12 (2024-01-21)

- We explored the house more. In the next room we found a bunch of odd statues and artworks. A ball rolled across the room and a voice started to speak to us. [Ravarel](pcs/ravarel-deshent.md) could see a ghost. She introduces herself as [anna](npcs/anna.md) and mentioned her father.
- In the next room we were attacked by shadows, and then putrid haunts.
	- The haunts exploded and threw leaches over people. To get them off [Kez](pcs/kez-bardaux.md), Raven poured a perfume on the leeches. Little did she know it was a love potion.
