# Session 62 (2025-02-16)

- [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) went to speak to [Xedalli](princess-xedalli.md) privately. He asked about what [The Stranger](the-stranger.md) had said about [Prince Xeleth](prince-xeleth.md)'s true name.
	- She explained how every person has a true name, but is not aware of it.
	- He kept pushing her about it but didn't get much response.
	- She said that "Anyone who knows either of our true names are in significantly more danger than if they hadn't."
- [Raven](raven.md) went to the galley to cook a Japanese curry.
	- She spoke with [Vraxil](vraxil-of-the-twilight.md).
	- He spoke about how he was part of an order that had given an oath to keep an evil sorceress imprisoned in the [Bright Desert](bright-desert.md) near the [Free City of Greyhawk](greyhawk.md).
	- He had been bound into a necklace and stolen by someone. That person had his neck slit by [Kas the Betrayer](kas-the-betrayer.md).
	- He was sold to a wizard who bound the necklace to silence, and had only been awakened when [Raven](raven.md) put it on.
	- They spoke a bit about Raven's service to Ilmater. He seemed skeptical of gods.
	- [Raven](raven.md) agreed to help return him to the desert, but asked that he stop threatening her friends.
- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) went to the garden and spoke with [The Sovereign](the-sovereign.md).
	- He tried to plant the mushroom, but [The Sovereign](the-sovereign.md) said that it was impossible and that they were bound together.
	- [The Sovereign](the-sovereign.md) demanded that they go to [Sigil](sigil.md) ASAP. They compelled [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) to be "a pain in the ass" until it happened.
	- He asked why they wanted to go to [Sigil](sigil.md). [The Sovereign](the-sovereign.md) said "the prophesy demands it".
- The team gathered to eat.
	- [Raven](raven.md) told the the team that [Vraxil](vraxil-of-the-twilight.md) would be friendly and mentioned the connection to [Kas](kas-the-betrayer.md).
	- [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) insisted that we go to [Sigil](sigil.md). We questioned him and he said that the voice wanted him to go there.
	- [The Sovereign](the-sovereign.md) told [Sssslattthhhhaaassss](sssslattthhhhaaassss.md) that he was doing a bad job of convincing everyone.
	- [The Stranger](the-stranger.md) said he needs to go to [The Radiant Citadel](the-radiant-citadel.md) quickly to "repay someone" there.
	- Akarran Sanger was the name of an "entity" in [The Radiant Citadel](the-radiant-citadel.md). An incarnate, looks like a tiger made of gemstones.
	- [Raven](raven.md) mentioned they would need to go to [Greyhawk](greyhawk.md) eventually. [The Stranger](the-stranger.md) seemed curious. [Kez](kez-bardaux.md) said it sounded "Vecna-ish" which alarmed [The Stranger](the-stranger.md). He asked that he don't say the name again.
- We headed directly to [The Radiant Citadel](the-radiant-citadel.md).
	- [The Stranger](the-stranger.md) mentioned the vibe seemed a little subuded.
	- He mentioned we needed to head to "The Preserve of the Ancestors".
	- As we got there we encountered some Armada guards with a bunch of constructs. They said the place was on lockdown and we needed to leave.
	- [The Stranger](the-stranger.md) said there was only one entrance to the buidling. The door was just a facade concealing an entrance to a demiplane.
	- We decided to attack the guards.
		- More armada-folk came from behind the doors; two mages and a commander.
