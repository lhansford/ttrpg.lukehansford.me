CRAFTING MUNDANE ITEMS: play a video game, this is Dungeons and Dragons not Dremels and Diagrams.  Your best bet is to purchase items like weapons and armor of non magic quality from a vendor.


CRAFTING MAGIC ITEMS:

Creating magical items requires proficiency with the following tools along with proficiency in the Arcana skill:

Herbalism kit   Antitoxin, potion of healing
Leatherworker’s tools   Leather armor, boots
Smith’s tools   Armor, weapons
Weaver’s tools  Cloaks, robes
Jewelers tools   rings, necklaces
etc....

Other magical items will require specific components, a blueprint/plan (aka knowledge), gold, and time.

Table below relays time and cost based on rarity.  State your desired item, rarity and cost is at GM discretion, but the below is a guide for most things.

Healing potion 4 pack = 1 work week + 100 GP
Greater Healing single Potion = 1 work week + 100 GP

GAMBLING
(may gamble with npc crew members or at port)

COST = One work week of effort + wager

Insight
Deception
Intimidation

If the character has proficiency with an appropriate gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks.

GM will set the DC on each occasion.

0 successes Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount.
1 success   Lose half the money you bet.
2 successes Gain the amount you bet plus half again more.
3 successes Gain double the amount you bet.

you must wager at least 25 GP, and no more than 500 GP


Street/Pit Fighting
(done at port, not available on ship)

COST = one work week

Make 3 checks:

Athletics
Acrobatics
Constitution

GM will set the DC on each occasion.

0 successes Lose your bouts, earning nothing.
1 success   Win 50 gp.
2 successes Win 100 gp.
3 successes Win 200 gp.

Religious Service participation
(done at port, not available on ship)

COST = 1 work week

Choose Religion or Persuasion

1-10 no effect
11-20+ gain one favor

A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple.

Research

Delve into lore, information on magic items, or another topic.

COST - Access to library, or a book on desired subject + 50GP

The character declares the focus of the research — a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. If at port, with a library gain advantage on the check.

1–5 No effect.
6–10    You learn one piece of lore.
11–20   You learn two pieces of lore.
21+ You learn three pieces of lore.


Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature’s resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on

WORK
(normally done at port but crew member may have job for you)

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character’s attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

Make a check related to the type of work (athletics, performance, acrobatics, intelligence)

9 or lower = 1 GP
10-14 = 5 GP
15-20 10 GP
20+ 25 GP

TRAINING

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character’s Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn’t increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.

RELAXATION

Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don’t want to make use of the downtime system.

COST = 1 work week (can not be combined into long trips for multiple benefits)

A character who spends their down time relaxing earns 3 luck points, (or a re-roll if not using optional luck rules) not to exceed the maximum of 5

SHIP IMPROVEMENTS

Characters can spend downtime on specific projects to make enhancements to the ship. While mostly cosmetic one might be able to upgrade weapons, increase storage, or make some otherwise mechanical improvement.  Generally speaking there is no in game way to change speed, AC, or spelljamming speed to a ship.  Talk to the GM re: modifications you would like.

SOMETHING ELSE

PCs may want to do something else, speak with your GM.  Please let me know with as much advance as possible for anything not related to the above.
