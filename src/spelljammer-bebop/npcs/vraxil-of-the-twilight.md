![|0x250](_files/Screenshot%202025-01-26%20at%2013.13.38.png)

- Undead spirit in the necklace [Raven](pcs/raven.md) swiped from [Containment Facility 53](locations/containment-facility-53.md).
- Necklace is made of Golden Retriever bones?
- He spoke about how he was part of an order that had given an oath to keep an evil sorceress imprisoned in the [Bright Desert](locations/bright-desert.md) near the [Free City of Greyhawk](locations/greyhawk.md).
- He had been bound into a necklace and stolen by someone. That person had his neck slit by [Kas the Betrayer](npcs/kas-the-betrayer.md).
- He was sold to a wizard who bound the necklace to silence, and had only been awakened when [Raven](pcs/raven.md) put it on.
- They spoke a bit about Raven's service to Ilmater. He seemed skeptical of gods.
- [Raven](pcs/raven.md) agreed to help return him to the desert, but asked that he stop threatening her friends.
