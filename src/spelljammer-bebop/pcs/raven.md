# Raven

![[_files/portrait.png|300]]![[_files/full-body-token.png|300]]
## Backstory

- Raven was originally a fey spirit. At some point she was bound by a wizard as their familiar. The wizard was cruel and evil, and she did his bidding as a familiar for a very long time.
- During her time in captivity she learnt about the teachings of Ilmater. She broke her bond with her master, replacing it with a pledge of service to Ilmater. Part of the bargain was providing me with a new form to more easily hide from my past.
- Transformed into a young teenager, Raven fled to Bral. She found refuge at the Temple of Ilmater, and ended up becoming an acolyte there. While she was trained as a cleric initially, her skills led her to a different role as a Blade of Ilmater, using her roguish skills to protect the suffering and oppressed.
- She has been on Bral for about a decade. Around 5 years ago she met Swan, and they became fast friends. In more recent years she has worked some jobs with Swan and Kez.

## Personality

> What is the lie they tell themself?

That violence can end suffering.
### Traits

- **Curiousity.** I am fascinated by seeing familiar places through the eyes of my new body.
- **Friendly**. I'm a little socially awkward and blunt, but overall quite friendly.
- **Forgiving.** I'm not opposed to spilling blood, but I'll try to avoid harming people too much if there's a chance they'll repent.
### Ideals

- **Freedom**. Better to die free than to live in chains. (Personal ideal)
- **Compassion**. Halt and relieve the suffering of others, and take it on yourself if you must. (Ilmater ideal)
### Bonds

- I loathe slavery and enchantments, and work to free those trapped by chains or magic.
	- Familiars in particular will incite me.
- I dislike disguises or changing my form further; I want the world to see me as I now am.

### Flaws

- I prefer to sleep in the same fashion that I rested when I was a familiar.
- Transmutation magic of all kinds frightens me to the core. I will not willingly use it or have it used on me.
- I'm scared of the dark as it reminds be of the void where my master would keep me when I wasn't doing his bidding.
- I do like shiny things, and will happily take something valuable from someone I deem doesn't need it, though I try to leave something else in return.
- She's a bit of a show-off (like a bird) and will sometimes be a bit extra when its unneeded.
- Strong distrust of domesticated animals (cats, cows, horses).

### Stats

- **INT**: High. Rational and good at connecting the dots.
- **WIS**: High. Empathetic and observant.
- **CHA**: Low. Lacking social finesse. Bad liar and will be very direct with people.
